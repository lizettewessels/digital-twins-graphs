abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine if students would patronize metaverse academic library (MAL) if it becomes available in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a descriptive survey research design. The population was made up of 1,037 undergraduate in Adeleke University. Descriptive statistic was used to analyse data. Findings: Findings indicated most students have never used virtual reality (VR) equipment, they are eager to use MAL for virtual academic research, library user education, accessing circulation services, reading serials and contacting reference librarians. The study concluded that MAL would be patronised by students if it is made available and therefore recommends that greater effort be made to make VR gear accessible and cheap for developing nations such as Nigeria. Originality/value: The study is novel as it contributes to scarce research on MAL.},

abstract = {The evolution of metaverse libraries offers a transformative pathway for redefining knowledge systems in the digital age. This study delves into the seamless integration of enduring library principles with the expansive capabilities of the metaverse, envisioning a harmonious coexistence that preserves traditional library values while propelling knowledge dissemination, inclusivity, and collaboration to new heights. Real-world case studies provide valuable insights into successful metaverse library implementations and offer lessons for future endeavors. By seamlessly merging traditional library attributes with immersive digital experiences, metaverse libraries can offer tailored learning journeys, foster global collaboration, and ensure secure content distribution. However, the landscape is not without challenges, such as privacy concerns, digital literacy gaps, and the imperative of inclusivity, all of which require thoughtful interdisciplinary collaboration. This evolution underscores the significance of preserving the essence of physical libraries while embracing the potential of the metaverse. Through adept navigation of these complexities, metaverse libraries have the capacity to revolutionize education, nurture collaboration, and ensure equitable access to knowledge in a dynamic and interconnected digital landscape.},

abstract = {Executive Summary This paper is the third of three, addressing the What, Why and How of ecosystems of connected digital twins. 1 • It details the necessary approaches to enable useful ecosystems of connected digital twins • It urges the need for an industry wide socio-technical change at individual, organisational, sectoral, national and international levels • It highlights the complexity of the road ahead and the need for collaboration across industry, academia and government on a national scale • It sets out the collaborative approach to develop common national resources for data sharing across organisational and sectoral boundaries This paper states that an ecosystem of connected digital twins should be developed with adopters, in the open, as a public resource. It shows that a socio-technical change programme is required to support the social, human connections between organisations and sectors which allow for the transfer of data and knowledge. We know a paradigm shift is required to break down silos in policy formulation and implementation that are producing suboptimal outcomes. We know we must collectively recognise the built environment as a system of systems and manage it accordingly with more collaborative models built on trust. That way we can create a built environment whose explicit purpose is to enable people and nature to flourish together for generations.},

@article{Enakrire2023,
abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate artificial intelligence (AI) as enabler of future library services, with consideration to how prepared are librarians in African university libraries. Design/methodology/approach: This study applied the interpretive content/document analysis of literature harvested from different databases of Scopus and Web of Science. AI could be used to perform daily routines in circulation, serial, reference and selective dissemination of information among others. It could also be applied to the provision of innovative services of recognition of library activities such as answering research quarries, cataloguing and classification of library materials and management of library system software of different databases within the library systems. Findings: It could be deduced from the study that AI would continue to serve as a panacea to future library services irrespective of its geographical context. Due to the evolving nature of knowledge growth, AI having its roots in the field of engineering has been found useful to support future library services. The support accrued from library service delivery in the library profession has made librarians continue to interact with other intelligent machines that can demonstrate human behaviour even though they are not real human beings. The behaviour of machines and AI where human beings play a significant role has brought many renovations in the management of complex tasks of processing, communication, knowledge representation, decision making and suggestions, on potentials of diverse work operations. Practical implications: The understanding that the present paper portrays in the context of future library services is that there is no way the AI could function without a human interaction perspective when drawing an analogy from computer science, information science and information systems fields of study. Social implications: The interest of users across their background would be strengthen if AI advances transformed the handling complex tasks of processing, communication, knowledge representation, decision-making and giving suggestions, among other things. The possibilities of diverse work operations from empirical evidence of studies consulted in recent times gave the authors the impetus to consider AI as the enabler of future library services. Originality/value: The increasing demands from library patrons have prompted librarians to adapt their methods of delivering services. These emerging technologies have also brought about shifts in approaches to teaching and learning. Consequently, the recent surge in digital technology-driven service innovations has ushered in a fresh paradigm for education and research. In response to these changes, librarians are actively seeking novel and innovative technologies to enhance user experiences within their libraries. They serve as catalysts for introducing modern and advanced technologies, consistently adapting to contemporary tools that enhance their offerings.},

This study used an empirical research method for collecting data from 211 librarians working in Pakistan's universities. On the basis of the findings of the MTAM analysis by structural equation modelling, the performances of the academic libraries were comprehended through the process of big data. The main influential components of the performance analysis in this study were the big data analytics capabilities, perceived ease of access and the usefulness of big data practices in academic libraries. Subsequently, the utilisation of big data was significantly affected by skills, perceived ease of access and the usefulness of academic libraries. The results also suggested that the various components of the academic libraries lead to effective organisational performance when linked to big data analytics.},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to further elaborate a new concept for value creation by decision support services in industrial service ecosystems using digital twins and to apply it to an extended case study. The aim of the original model was to design and integrate an architecture of digital twins derived from business needs that leveraged the potential of the synergies in the ecosystem. The conceptual framework presented in this paper extends the semantic ontology model for integrating the digital twins. For the original model, technical modeling approaches were developed and integrated into an ecosystem perspective based on a modeling of the ecosystem and the actors' decision jobs. In a service ecosystem comprising several enterprises and a multitude of actors, decision making is based on the interlinkage of the digital twins of the equipment and the processes, which is achieved by the semantic ontology model further elaborated in this paper. The implementation of the digital twin architecture is shown in the example of a manufacturing SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) case that was introduced in. The mixed semantic modeling and model-based systems engineering for this implementation is discussed in further detail in this paper. The findings of this detailed study provide a theoretical concept for implementing digital twins on the level of service ecosystems and integrating digital twins based on a unified ontology. This provides a practical blueprint to companies for developing digital twin based services in their own operations and beyond in their ecosystem.},

abstract = {This manuscript discusses the key characteristics of the Digital Ecosystems (DEs) model, which, we argue, is particularly appropriate for connecting and orchestrating the many heterogeneous and autonomous online systems, infrastructures, and platforms that constitute the bedrock of a digitally transformed society. Big Data and AI systems have enabled the implementation of the Digital Twin paradigm (introduced first in the manufacturing sector) in all the sectors of society. DEs promise to be a flexible and operative framework that allow the development of local, national, and international Digital Twins. In particular, the “Digital Twins of the Earth” may generate the actionable intelligence that is necessary to address global change challenges, facilitate the European Green transition, and contribute to realizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda. The case of the Destination Earth initiative and system is discussed in the manuscript as an example to address the broader DE concepts. In respect to the more traditional data and information infrastructural philosophy, DE solutions present important advantages as to flexibility and viability. However, designing and implementing an effective collaborative DE is far more difficult than a traditional digital system. DEs require the definition and the governance of a metasystemic level, which is not necessary for a traditional information system. The manuscript discusses the principles, patterns, and architectural viewpoints characterizing a thriving DE supporting the generation and operation of “Digital Twins of the Earth”.

@article{Oladokun2023,
abstract = {The emergence of the metaverse is a notable trend in the field of librarianship that comes with it the capability to facilitate virtual interactions, stimulate engagement, and offer participatory experiences for both librarians and library users. This article delves into the potential applications of the metaverse within libraries. To explore this subject, the researchers conducted a systematic literature review, collecting secondary data that aligns with the study's objectives. The findings emphasize the significance of developing metaliteracy among librarians and library users in the context of the metaverse. Metaliteracy encompasses a diverse set of skills that are essential for thriving in the digital age. Nevertheless, it also presents challenges, such as rapid technological advancements and disparities in accessibility. In response to these challenges, libraries and librarians must adapt by harnessing the power of metaliteracy to unlock the metaverse's potential fully. The article proposes that libraries should provide ongoing training and support for digital librarians and library users to ensure the relevance of their metaliteracy skills. Furthermore, libraries should actively foster collaborative partnerships with entities within the metaverse, including virtual museums and galleries. This collaborative approach enriches the pool of information and resources available to library users, ultimately enhancing their overall experience.},

abstract = {This study aims to investigate the factors influencing the usage intentions of metaverse technology in digital library services within higher learning institutions, using the unified system information theory. To achieve this, an online survey was conducted among university staff and students, utilizing a link-scale measurement. Various factors affecting the usage intention of metaverse technology in library services were computed through transformation models such as UTAUT, DM, ISS, and TTF. Subsequently, the model parameters were empirically tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to identify the significant factors influencing the usage intention of metaverse technology. The results of the study reveal that users' intentions to use metaverse technology in digital library systems are influenced by perceptions of system use, perceived interaction, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use. Notably, these influences vary depending on the user's intended task. These findings provide valuable insights into the factors that affect the adoption and usage intentions of metaverse technology in the context of digital library services in higher learning institutions. This research contributes to enhancing understanding and guiding future strategies for leveraging metaverse technology effectively in educational environments.},

@techreport{Williamson2020,
abstract = {In early 2019 UCU decided to review the extent and impact of automation in the higher education sector and to seek to begin to draw together a set of recommendations for trade unions and like-minded bodies. We commissioned the research which comprises the bulk of this report from Dr Ben Williamson from the Centre for Research in Digital Education at the University of Edinburgh, and who has written and researched extensively on the issue. We asked him to review the current reach of automation into higher education and begin to consider what an appropriate response might be. The nature of automation is such that it is constantly evolving and much of what this report details will be outdated in the not too distant future. Indeed, while this report looked at the role of automation on universities the Covid-19 crisis, that erupted after this report was first drafted, has highlighted the significance of remote working and the phenomena of 'Working From Home' in the automated university. Most starkly the gendered nature of this development with predominantly women trying both to maintain work activities whilst retaining primary responsibilities as carers brings equality issues to the fore in any discussion around technology and the university. It is important that trade unions representing workers on our campuses and other interested groups are on top of what is occurring and are giving consideration to an appropriate approach. This report and accompanying recommendations seek to play a role in developing this thinking.},
