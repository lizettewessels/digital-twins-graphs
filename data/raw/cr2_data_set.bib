abstract = {Robotics and automation have been a growing area within K–12 educational institutions for the past decade. Across secondary educational institutions, students are introduced to robotics in classes, after-school clubs, and competition leagues through various educational platforms, vendors, and kits. Robotics was initially implemented in schools to help drive more interest in STEM through hands-on application of mechanical, electrical, structural, and computer engineering concepts. Recently, the trend of K–12 robotics has become very niche, focusing more on mobile robotics or robotics competitions. Because of this trend, students have limited exposure to emerging technological advances, such as those found in Industry 4.0. Exciting technological areas, such as digital twins, are not covered in curricula, and this lack of exposure negatively influences the direction of student interest in the “T” and “E” of STEM, with many students never pursuing computer science, technology, or robotics in higher education. The primary goal of this research is to provide a methodology to expose secondary students to Industry 4.0 technologies by leveraging accessible technologies, such as Unity and the Robot Operating System (ROS), to develop a low-cost, high-fidelity digital twin of a pick-and-place robot in a smart warehouse operation. This digital twin prototype will help students to learn about Industry 4.0 trends, such as next-generation automation systems, digital twins, digital manufacturing, intelligent automation, and additive manufacturing, using ROS–Unity integration and hardware accessible to secondary schools to simulate a pick-and-place robotic application. By harnessing the accessibility of Unity and ROS to create a low-cost digital twin prototype for a secondary school, this research has a secondary goal of improving the pipeline of students interested in pursuing STEM-related learning in higher education, thereby ensuring a future STEM workforce that can research, design, develop, operate, and maintain the systems and technologies of Industry 4.0.},

abstract = {The concept of the Digital Twin (DT), a digital replica of a physical object or process, is relatively new to the higher education context. The increase in the application of DT technology across many industries has prompted the call for greater exploration of the possibilities for DTs in education along with a consideration of the challenges to their implementation. There are also questions being raised about the opportunity to develop DTs of learners to extend the use of data to inform learning and teaching, which has been boosted by the recent rise of learning analytics and educational data mining. In this paper we will explore what DT technology is and offer a new definition of DTs that can be used in the educational context. Current uses and the potential future applications will be explored, as well as consideration of what is necessary to build DTs of learners (and educators). The use of DT technology also poses many challenges due to the complexity of DT design and application, and these will be outlined. The paper concludes with a discussion of future directions and areas where more research is needed to fully explore the potential of DT for higher education.},

abstract = {Recent technological developments and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled sophisticated capabilities to be a part of digital twins (DTs), virtually making it possible to introduce automation into all aspects ofwork processes. Given these possibilities that DT can offer, practitioners are facing increasingly difficult decisions regarding what capabilities to select when deploying a DT in practice. The lack of research in this field has not helped. It has resulted in the rebranding and reuse of emerging technological capabilities such as prediction, simulation, AI, and machine learning (ML) as necessary constituents of DT. Inappropriate selection of capabilities in a DT can result in missed opportunities, strategic misalignments, inflated expectations, and the risk of it being rejected as hype by the practitioners. To alleviate this challenge, this paper proposes a digitalization framework, designed and developed by following a design science research (DSR) methodology over a period of 18 months. The framework can help practitioners select an appropriate level of sophistication in a DT by weighing the pros and cons for each level, determining evaluation criteria for the digital twin system, and assessing the implications of the selected DT on the organizational processes and strategies and value creation. Three real-life case studies illustrated the application and usefulness of the framework.},

abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) technology is far from being comprehensive and mature, resulting in their piecemeal implementation in practice where some functions are automated by DTs, and others are still performed by humans. This piecemeal implementation of DTs often leaves practitioners wondering what roles (or functions) to allocate to DTs in a work system, and how might it impact humans. A lack of knowledge about the roles that humans and DTs play in a work system can result in significant costs, misallocation of resources, unrealistic expectations from DTs, and strategic misalignments. To alleviate this challenge, this paper answers the research question: When humans work with DTs, what types of roles can a DT play, and to what extent can those roles be automated? Specifically, we propose a two-dimensional conceptual framework, Levels of Digital Twin (LoDT). The framework is an integration of the types of roles a DT can play, broadly categorized under (1) Observer, (2) Analyst, (3) Decision Maker, and (4) Action Executor, and the extent of automation for each of these roles, divided into five different levels ranging from completely manual to fully automated. A particular DT can play any number of roles at varying levels. The framework can help practitioners systematically plan DT deployments, clearly communicate goals and deliverables, and lay out a strategic vision. A case study illustrates the usefulness of the framework.},

abstract = {Following the fourth industrial revolution, and with the recent advances in information and communication technologies, the digital twinning concept is attracting the attention of both academia and industry worldwide. A microgrid digital twin (MGDT) refers to the digital representation of a microgrid (MG), which mirrors the behavior of its physical counterpart by using high-fidelity models and simulation platforms as well as real-time bi-directional data exchange with the real twin. With the massive deployment of sensor networks and IoT technologies in MGs, a huge volume of data is continuously generated, which contains valuable information to enhance the performance of MGs. MGDTs provide a powerful tool to manage the huge historical data and real-time data stream in an efficient and secure manner and support MGs' operation by assisting in their design, operation management, and maintenance. In this paper, the concept of the digital twin (DT) and its key characteristics are introduced. Moreover, a workflow for establishing MGDTs is presented. The goal is to explore different applications of DTs in MGs, namely in design, control, operator training, forecasting, fault diagnosis, expansion planning, and policy-making. Besides, an up-to-date overview of studies that applied the DT concept to power systems and specifically MGs is provided. Considering the significance of situational awareness, security, and resilient operation for MGs, their potential enhancement in light of digital twinning is thoroughly analyzed and a conceptual model for resilient operation management of MGs is presented. Finally, future trends in MGDTs are discussed.},

abstract = {Sustainable development was defined by the UN in 1987 as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, and this is a core concept in this paper. This work acknowledges the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e., economic, social, and environmental, but its focus is on this last one. A digital twin (DT) is frequently described as a physical entity with a virtual counterpart, and the data, connections between the two, implying the existence of connectors and blocks for efficient and effective data communication. This paper provides a meta systematic literature review (SLR) (i.e., an SLR of SLRs) regarding the sustainability requirements of DT-based systems. Numerous papers on the subject of DT were also selected because they cited the analyzed SLRs and were considered relevant to the purposes of this research. From the selection and analysis of 29 papers, several limitations and challenges were identified: the perceived benefits of DTs are not clearly understood; DTs across the product life cycle or the DT life cycle are not sufficiently studied; it is not clear how DTs can contribute to reducing costs or supporting decision-making; technical implementation of DTs must be improved and better integrated in the context of the IoT; the level of fidelity of DTs is not entirely evaluated in terms of their parameters, accuracy, and level of abstraction; and the ownership of data stored within DTs should be better understood. Furthermore, from our research, it was not possible to find a paper discussing DTs only in regard to environmental sustainability.},

abstract = {This research introduces a conceptual framework designed to enhance worker safety and well-being in industrial environments, such as oil and gas construction plants, by leveraging Human Digital Twin (HDT) cutting-edge technologies and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. At its core, this study is in the developmental phase, aiming to create an integrated system that could enable real-time monitoring and analysis of the physical, mental, and emotional states of workers. It provides valuable insights into the impact of Digital Twins (DT) technology and its role in Industry 5.0. With the development of a chatbot trained as an empathic evaluator that analyses emotions expressed in written conversations using natural language processing (NLP); video logs capable of extracting emotions through facial expressions and speech analysis; and personality tests, this research intends to obtain a deeper understanding of workers' psychological characteristics and stress levels. This innovative approach might enable the identification of stress, anxiety, or other emotional factors that may affect worker safety. Whilst this study does not encompass a case study or an application in a real-world setting, it lays the groundwork for the future implementation of these technologies. The insights derived from this research are intended to inform the development of practical applications aimed at creating safer work environments.},

abstract = {Digital twin and physical internet adoption based on advanced digital technologies is gaining significance in the recent times. Digital twin is one of the enabling technologies that link actual physical system with its virtual depiction using advanced digital technologies. In order to leverage its potential, firms have instigated to adopt digital twin and physical internet for real-world applications. Although researches on impact of information technology in supply chains exists, a study on the modelling aspects by analysing critical success factors for adoption of digital twin and physical internet is limited. We have addressed this gap by developing a structural model for identifying the inter-relationships and cause effect parameters of critical success factors for adoption of digital twin and physical internet. Thirteen critical success factors were shortlisted based on literature review and in consultation with experts. An integrated Grey- based, decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)is used to visualize the causal relationships among critical success factors and verified by applying the proposed model in an electronics manufacturing firm. Sensitivity analysis has been done to check accuracy of results and robustness of the study. The results reveal that top management commitment and support and long, medium and short term planning are the most influential factors impacting the adoption of digital twin and physical internet in electronics industry. Findings of this research provide insights for supply chain managers and academicians by identifying the cause and effect group critical success factors for effective adoption of digital twin and physical internet.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers. Amid the rapid development of information communication technologies (ICTs), residents of future smart cities are expected to be exposed to unprecedented amounts of real-Time information on a daily basis. The cognitive overload driven by an excess of complex information has become a potential issue. Nonetheless, standardized information systems are still widely used, despite individual differences in information intake. To set a foundation for the intelligent information systems of smart cities, this paper introduces methods and tools for a cognition-driven, personalized information system, which acknowledges individual differences in information preference and helps reduce the cognitive load in daily lives and at work. The proposed method includes the use of virtual reality (VR) to simulate complex tasks paired with the digital twin modeling of workers' cognitive reactions to different information formats and contents in VR simulation. Collected data are then used to build a personal digital twins model of information-driven cognition, or Cog-DT. A human subject experiment was performed with a simulated industrial facility shutdown maintenance task as a proof of concept of Cog-DT. The latest neuroimaging technology and analysis methods were applied to model unique cognitive processes pertaining to information processing. Results indicate that cognitive activities driven by different information stimuli in the work context are distinguishable and modelable with Cog-DT methods and tools. This study is expected to contribute to digital twin literature by testing a human-centered, individual-level digital twin modeling method of cognitive activities. It also sets a preliminary foundation for developing personalized information systems for the smart cities of the future.},

abstract = {The concept of Digitals Twins (DTs) is an evolving idea, which is becoming the center of attention for the industry and the scientific community. It can be described as the pairing of the digital and the physical, interconnected for data sharing. DT is a key enabler for Industry 4.0, especially on the digitalization and visualization processes. Even though the idea of DT has been defined thoroughly throughout the recent years, there are still many different interpretations which are the result of different viewpoints of the involved professionals. The digitalization process requires huge amounts of data, which is generated, collected, handled and processed by various sources as well as digital twins themselves, thus offering new challenges that need to be addressed. In this paper, we attempt to i) assess the current state of digital twins, ii) describe the terms digital model and digital shadow as they are often misused as synonyms and iii) review the concepts of Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0 and discuss how these are connected. Moreover, some applications of DTs and their enabling technologies will be presented.},

abstract = {Currently, studies involving a digital twin are gaining widespread interest. While the first fields adopting such a concept were in manufacturing and engineering, lately, interest extends also beyond these fields across all academic disciplines. Given the inviting idea behind a digital twin which allows the efficient exploitation and utilization of simulations such a trend is understandable. The purpose of this paper is to use a scientometrics approach to study the early publication history of the digital twin across academia. Our analysis is based on large-scale bibliographic and citation data from Scopus that provides authoritative information about high-quality publications in essentially all fields of science, engineering and humanities. This paper has four major objectives. First, we obtain a global overview of all publications related to a digital twin across all major subject areas. This analysis provides insights into the structure of the entire publication corpus. Second, we investigate the co-occurrence of subject areas appearing together on publications. This reveals interdisciplinary relations of the publications and identifies the most collaborative fields. Third, we conduct a trend and keyword analysis to gain insights into the evolution of the concept and the importance of keywords. Fourth, based on results from topic modeling using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model we introduce the definition of a scientometric dimension (SD) of digital twin research that allows to summarize an important aspect of the bound diversity of the academic literature.},

abstract = {A growing number of firms are seeking to leverage emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and 3D printing, to enhance their innovation efforts. These seemingly distinct technologies are currently coalescing into an encompassing new technology called the digital twin. This technology allows innovative firms to create a digital replica of a physical entity that evolves over its life cycle. This article explores the implications of the digital twin for innovation theory and practice. First, we examine the connection between the digital twin and three related technologies (i.e., 3D printing, big data, and AI). Second, we create a typology of four categories of digital twins (i.e., monitoring, making, enhancing, and replicating) and illustrate their relevance for innovation management. Third, we offer a set of four case studies that exemplify this typology and illustrate how digital twins have been put into practice. Fourth, we craft a set of digital twin-related future research directions that encompasses a broad range of innovation-related topics, including service innovation, co-creation, and product design. We hope that our examination of the digital twin serves as a catalyst to help advance innovation thought and practice in this intriguing new domain.},

abstract = {Engineering education providers should foresee the potential of digital transformation of teaching and skill-developing activities so that graduating engineers can find themselves highly aligned with the demands and attributes needed by prospective industrial employers. The advancement of industrial revolutions towards hybridisation of the enabling technologies recognised by Industry 4.0, Society 5.0, and Industry 5.0 have transformed the components of the engineering higher education system remarkably. Future workforce requirements will demand an employee's multidisciplinary skill mix and other professional qualities. Implementing human-centric decision-making based on insights from the Digital Twin (DT) systems, sustainability, and lean systems is necessary for further economic growth. Recent barriers identified by the Australian Council of Engineering Deans, the development of teaching capabilities, and affordable and digitally transformed learning facilities by education providers were all considered. This paper explores the role of Digital Twins (DTs) in enhancing engineering higher education by incorporating Industry 4.0 components and other industrial advances. By reviewing curricula, pedagogy, and the evolving skill requirements for engineering graduates, this study identifies key benefits of DTs, such as cost-effectiveness, resource management, and immersive learning experiences. This paper also outlines challenges in implementing DT-based labs, including IT infrastructure, data quality, privacy, and security issues. The findings indicate that engineering education should embrace DTs to foster multidisciplinary skills and human-centric decision-making to meet future workforce demands. Collaboration with industry is highlighted as a crucial factor in the successful transformation of teaching practices and in offering real-world experiences. The COVID-19 pandemic has expedited the adoption of DT technologies, demonstrating their utility in minimising educational disruptions. While this paper acknowledges the high potential of DTs to prepare engineering students for future industry demands, it also emphasises the need for professional development among educators to ensure effective and balanced implementation.},

Most recently, these technologies have assisted in the global fight of the COVID-19 pandemic and other societal problems. Together with these innovative techniques, the concept of circular economy and its relevant tools such as life cycle costing, life cycle impact assessment, materials passports, and circularity measurements have been implemented in a number of sectors in different countries for the transition from a linear “take, make, and dispose” model towards a more circular model, which has shown positive results for the environment and economy. In this article, with the help of implementation, prototyping, and case studies, we explore how these technological advancements and innovative techniques are used in different sectors such as information and communications technology, the built environment, mining and manufacturing, education, healthcare, the public sectors, and others to provide an opportunity to understand and resolve the agreed upon framework in 2015 by 193 countries, that is, the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.},

This is accompanied by increased dependence on virtual product and process development, data‐driven processes, and product knowledge. Other characteristics, affecting modern design, include big data intelligence in product, process, and maintenance. New technologies that empower data analytics include added manufacturing, flexible manufacturing, robotics, sensor technology, smart value/supply chains, and industrial information backbones. This paper is about surrogate models, also called digital twins , that provide an important complementary capacity to physical assets. Digital twins capture past, present, and predicted behavior of physical assets. Digital twin models are updated periodically to represent the current state of physical assets. This distinguishes digital twins from conventional simulations in that sensor data can continuously feed them. The type of curated information on the state of physical asset's history depends on how digital twins are used. For example, if a digital twin is used for fault classification, the history captured is operational data from equipment in healthy and faulty states. We provide here a review of digital twins, with an emphasis on Industry 4.0 applications.},

The results show that at the individual company level, the emergence of the ecosystems is determined by goal orientation and willingness to share information. The expected benefits are related to effective resource utilization, possibilities for co-learning, and new business creation. At the ecosystem level, forming a digital twin business ecosystem requires technical receptivity and common interests and goals among the members, as well as a strong customer-centric approach. At its best, a digital twin business ecosystem provides inter-organizational value for its members. This study provides new insights into developing new ecosystem-based services related to digital twins, both from the service provider and utilizer viewpoints. Further studies could broaden the implications by testing the relationships between specific preconditions and benefits at the company and ecosystem levels.},

abstract = {Nowadays, data is considered as a new life force for operations of physical systems in various domains such as manufacturing, healthcare, transportations, etc. However, the hugely generated data, which mirrors the working essence of the product life cycle, is still underutilised. Digital Twin (DT), a collective representation of active and passive captured data, is a virtual counterpart of the physical resources that could help prevent effective preventive maintenance in any applied domain. Currently, lots of research is going on about the applicability of digital twin in smart IOT based manufacturing industry 4.0 environment. Still, it lacks a formal study, which can provide a bird's eye view about the research efforts and directions. In this paper, the authors represent a bibliometric survey of the digital twin concept based on the Scopus database to present a global view about scholars' contributions in the manufacturing area. The study was conducted by retrieving 844 Scopus research papers published from 2015-2020 and analysed to find out critical insights such as publication volume, co-authorship networks, citation analysis, and demographic research distribution. The study revealed that significant contribution is made via concept propositions in conferences and some papers published in the journal. However, there is a scope of lots of research work in the direction of actual and secure digital twin implementation.},

abstract = {Advanced computer technologies such as big data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), cloud computing, digital twins, and edge computing have been applied in various fields as digitalization has progressed. To study the status of the application of digital twins in the combination with AI, this paper classifies the applications and prospects of AI in digital twins by studying the research results of the current published literature. We discuss the application status of digital twins in the four areas of aerospace, intelligent manufacturing in production workshops, unmanned vehicles, and smart city transportation, and we review the current challenges and topics that need to be looked forward to in the future. It was found that the integration of digital twins and AI has significant effects in aerospace flight detection simulation, failure warning, aircraft assembly, and even unmanned flight. In the virtual simulation test of automobile autonomous driving, it can save 80% of the time and cost, and the same road conditions reduce the parameter scale of the actual vehicle dynamics model and greatly improve the test accuracy. In the intelligent manufacturing of production workshops, the establishment of a virtual workplace environment can provide timely fault warning, extend the service life of the equipment, and ensure the overall workshop operational safety. In smart city traffic, the real road environment is simulated, and traffic accidents are restored, so that the traffic situation is clear and efficient, and urban traffic management can be carried out quickly and accurately. Finally, we looked forward to the future of digital twins and AI, hoping to provide a reference for future research in related fields.},

abstract = {Digital Twins (DTs) are one of the disruptive technologies associated with the Industry 4.0 concept. A DT connects the physical manufacturing system with the digital cyberspace, via the synchronization of the simulation (i.e., physical configurations) and data models (i.e., product, process, and resource models) of the manufacturing system. This synchronization of both worlds—the physical and digital—allows one to address the issue of manufacturing customized products. This challenge of mass customization (1) puts forward the goal of achieving the highest level of customer satisfaction, and (2) creates the need for the optimization of the complete value creation process. Within an Industry 4.0 context, the latter is translated as the interlinking of production resources and systems, via a DT, as it is in the physical world where the actual value-creation process takes place. The success of an Industry 4.0 mass customization environment (or mass customization 4.0), depends on its degree/level of sustainability. For these reasons, the present paper presents a review of relevant concepts related to the role of DTs in the achievement of a mass customization 4.0 environment, plus some proposals of how to address the identified research challenges. A future research agenda is proposed at the end of the paper.},

abstract = {Digital Twins have been described as beneficial in many areas, such as virtual commissioning, fault prediction or reconfiguration planning. Equipping Digital Twins with artificial intelligence functionalities can greatly expand those beneficial applications or open up altogether new areas of application, among them cross-phase industrial transfer learning. In the context of machine learning, transfer learning represents a set of approaches that enhance learning new tasks based upon previously acquired knowledge. Here, knowledge is transferred from one lifecycle phase to another in order to reduce the amount of data or time needed to train a machine learning algorithm. Looking at common challenges in developing and deploying industrial machinery with deep learning functionalities, embracing this concept would offer several advantages: Using an intelligent Digital Twin, learning algorithms can be designed, configured and tested in the design phase before the physical system exists and real data can be collected. Once real data becomes available, the algorithms must merely be fine-tuned, significantly speeding up commissioning and reducing the probability of costly modifications. Furthermore, using the Digital Twin's simulation capabilities virtually injecting rare faults in order to train an algorithm's response or using reinforcement learning, e.g. to teach a robot, become practically feasible. This article presents several cross-phase industrial transfer learning use cases utilizing intelligent Digital Twins. A real cyber physical production system consisting of an automated welding machine and an automated guided vehicle equipped with a robot arm is used to illustrate the respective benefits.},

abstract = {Digital twins can be defined as digital representations of physical entities that employ real-time data to enable understanding of the operating conditions of these entities. Here we present a particular type of digital twin that involves a combination of computer vision, scientific machine learning, and augmented reality. This novel digital twin is able, therefore, to see, to interpret what it sees—and, if necessary, to correct the model it is equipped with—and presents the resulting information in the form of augmented reality. The computer vision capabilities allow the twin to receive data continuously. As any other digital twin, it is equipped with one or more models so as to assimilate data. However, if persistent deviations from the predicted values are found, the proposed methodology is able to correct on the fly the existing models, so as to accommodate them to the measured reality. Finally, the suggested methodology is completed with augmented reality capabilities so as to render a completely new type of digital twin. These concepts are tested against a proof-of-concept model consisting on a nonlinear, hyperelastic beam subjected to moving loads whose exact position is to be determined.},

Artificial intelligence and other digital technologies that have emerged in the last years, are being currently applied in virtually every area of society, economy and the environment. Hence, it is unsurprising that their current role in the pursuance or hampering of the SDGs has become critical. This study aims at providing a snapshot and comprehensive view of the progress made and prospects in the relationship between artificial intelligence technologies and the SDGs. A comprehensive review of existing literature has been firstly conducted, after which a series SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analyses have been undertaken to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats inherent to artificial intelligence-driven technologies as facilitators or barriers to each of the SDGs. Based on the results of these analyses, a subsequent broader analysis is provided, from a position vantage, to (i) identify the efforts made in applying AI technologies in SDGs, (ii) pinpoint opportunities for further progress along the current decade, and (iii) distill ongoing challenges and target areas for important advances. The analysis is organized into six categories or perspectives of human needs: life, economic and technological development, social development, equality, resources and natural environment. Finally, a closing discussion is provided about the prospects, key guidelines and lessons learnt that should be adopted for guaranteeing a positive shift of artificial intelligence developments and applications towards fully supporting the SDGs attainment by 2030.},

Digital Twin (DT) is an AI-based virtual replica of the real-world physical entity. DTs have been successfully adopted in manufacturing and industrial sectors, they are however still at the early stage in smart city based applications. The major reason for this lag is the lack of trust and privacy issues in sharing sensitive data. Federated Learning (FL) is a technology that could be integrated along with DT to ensure privacy preservation and trustworthiness. This paper focuses on the integration of these two promising technologies for adoption in real-time and life-critical scenarios, as well as for ease of governance in smart city based applications. We present an extensive survey on the various smart city based applications of FL models in DTs. Based on the study, some prominent challenges and future directions are presented for better FL–DT integration in future applications.},

abstract = {The notions of smart construction and smart or digital cities include many modern concepts that are advocated today, especially in countries with advanced economies, and depend on using information technology and the Internet of Things as a basis to automate processes and activate digital systems to manage activities and services related to the operation of buildings and urban structures. In light of the spread of digital technology and modern managerial approaches, the concept of a digital twin is being used on a large scale with the current trend and direction to digitalize activities providing many economic, social and technical advantages. A digital twin is a system in which a virtual representation of a real entity or physical system is used continuously by being fed with data and deriving outputs in the form of decisions and actions that are generated through the processes of machine learning, simulation, development and lifecycle management. This study aims to review the literature on construction project management through the lens of digital twins and ways to use them in the field to improve operational results. The authors propose a framework for analyzing and supervising the development of digital twins that uses three main stages: the commonly encountered Building Information Modeling (BIM); the existing monitoring and actuation digital twins; and an envisioned third stage that makes use of artificial intelligence, complex visualization instruments and advanced controls with the capability to exact change within a construction project on the building site.},

@article{Sharma2022,
abstract = {Digital Twin was introduced over a decade ago, as an innovative all-encompassing tool, with perceived benefits including real-time monitoring, simulation, optimisation and accurate forecasting. However, the theoretical framework and practical implementations of digital twin (DT) are yet to fully achieve this vision at scale. Although an increasing number of successful implementations exist in research and industrial works, sufficient implementation details are not publicly available, making it difficult to fully assess their components and effectiveness, to draw comparisons, identify successful solutions, share lessons, and thus to jointly advance and benefit from the DT methodology. This work first presents a review of relevant DT research and industrial works, focusing on the key DT features, current approaches in different domains, and successful DT implementations, to infer the key DT components and properties, and to identify current limitations and reasons behind the delay in the widespread implementation and adoption of digital twin. This work identifies that the major reasons for this delay are: the fact the DT is still a fast evolving concept; the lack of a universal DT reference framework, e.g. DT standards are scarce and still evolving; problem- and domain-dependence; security concerns over shared data; lack of DT performance metrics; and reliance of digital twin on other fast-evolving technologies. Advancements in machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT) and big data have led to significant improvements in DT features such as real-time monitoring and accurate forecasting. Despite this progress and individual company-based efforts, certain research and implementation gaps exist in the field, which have so far prevented the widespread adoption of the DT concept and technology; these gaps are also discussed in this work. Based on reviews of past work and the identified gaps, this work then defines a conceptualisation of DT which includes its components and properties; these also validate the uniqueness of DT as a concept, when compared to similar concepts such as simulation, autonomous systems and optimisation. Real-life case studies are used to showcase the application of the conceptualisation. This work discusses the state-of-the-art in DT, addresses relevant and timely DT questions, and identifies novel research questions, thus contributing to a better understanding of the DT paradigm and advancing the theory and practice of DT and its allied technologies.},

abstract = {The scientific discussion on the Digital Twin gained substantial momentum within the last couple of years. In the context of Industry 4.0, the Digital Twin in the broadest sense refers to the concept of a coupled virtual representation of a physical asset. The asset types may range from products and processes to whole production systems. Different authors offer a variety of interpretations on the actual nature of the Digital Twin, often defining it via implicit functional aspects rather than giving explicit definitions. At the same time, some authors use the term merely as a catchphrase, thus applying blur to this emerging paradigm. At this point, a comprehensive understanding as well as a unifying model of the Digital Twin are absent. This paper therefore provides a structured review of the body of relevant literature with the specific focus on finding explicit definitions of the term "Digital Twin"as well as stated models characterizing the Digital Twin concept. As a result, a relevance assessment provides the most important literature regarding the research questions. The found explicit definitions, being partly conflicting, are presented. Similar notions like Product Avatar and Digital Shadow are assorted accordingly. Further, depictions of Digital Twin models stated in the most relevant literature as well as derived Digital Twin purposes are provided. Thus, this paper extends the theoretical foundation, thereby setting a basis for future augmented Digital Twin modeling.},

abstract = {The current technology push towards Industry 4.0 has provoked companies to gather exponential larger amounts of data. The sheer amount of data, as well as the implicit and explicit interrelations have increased the organisational complexity. As a result, companies lose control, have difficulties in reaching decisions, while unknowingly creating information and knowledge gaps - irrespective of the abundance of data available. Digital twinning technology can be instrumental to this problem. The technology allows for reasoning from the information content, bringing together the current situation and the expected course of process, while simultaneously aiming to predict future possibilities based on the information content. To achieve an effective and efficient implementation of digital twinning technology a purpose-driven approach is proposed. An approach towards defining the purpose can be facilitated by following the 3P characterisation: Purpose, Perspective and Priority. The incorporation of the 3P characterisation will lead information provision that is derived from the defined purpose. This can also be called purpose-driven information management. In this paper two projects are explained that will be used as use-cases to evaluate and validate the theory of purpose-driven information management and the 3P characterisation.},

abstract = {In recent times, the emergence of the Metaverse has garnered worldwide attention as an innovative digital space that holds immense potential to provide a wide range of health services to medical professionals and patients. With increasing stress on healthcare systems, it has become crucial to explore the latest and cost-effective solutions that can provide fast and reliable medical services. The focus of this study, therefore, is to explore applications of metaverse in various health care systems and elaborate on how it can efficiently improve the clinical management of patients. Consequently, an in-depth assessment of the metaverse has been carried out, while covering its core fundamentals, key technologies, and diverse applications in healthcare and medicine, including but not limited to, emergency response learning, hands-on experience in anatomy learning, orthopaedics, paediatrics and so on. To carry out the study, we have used an exploratory approach to analyze qualitative data on healthcare metaverse services in our systematic review. Relevant articles from scientific databases such as Web of Science, Springer, Scopus, and IEEE have been identified, and the analysis has been conducted using the PRISMA reporting guideline to ensure transparent and comprehensive reporting. The results of the study suggest that the metaverse has the potential to transform healthcare systems by introducing novel methods for delivering healthcare services. Metaverse's AR/VR technologies can enable remote medical consultations and training, benefiting patients and healthcare professionals. Additionally, patients can access health-related information and resources, empowering them to manage their health better and make more informed decisions.},

abstract = {While digital twins (DTs) have achieved significant visibility, they continue to face a problem of lack of harmonisation regarding their interpretation and definition. This diverse and interchangeable use of terms makes it challenging for scientific activities to take place and for organisations to grasp the existing opportunities and how can these benefit their businesses. This article aims to shift the focus away from debating a definition for a DT. Instead, it proposes a conceptual approach to the digital twinning of engineering physical assets as an ongoing process with variable complexity and evolutionary capacity over time. To accomplish this, the article presents a functional architecture of digital twinning, grounded in the foundational elements of the DT, to reflect the various forms and levels of digital twinning (LoDT) of physical assets throughout their life cycles. Furthermore, this work presents UNI-TWIN—a unified model to assist organisations in assessing the LoDT of their assets and to support investment planning decisions. Three case studies from the road and rail sector validate its applicability. UNI-TWIN helps to redirect the discussion around DTs and emphasise the opportunities and challenges presented by the diverse realities of digital twinning, namely in the context of engineering asset management.},

abstract = {Natural hazards, which have the potential to cause catastrophic damage and loss to infrastructure, have increased significantly in recent decades. Thus, the construction demand for disaster prevention and mitigation for infrastructure (DPMI) systems is increasing. Many studies have applied intelligence technologies to solve key aspects of infrastructure, such as design, construction, disaster prevention and mitigation, and rescue and recovery; however, systematic construction is still lacking. Digital twin (DT) is one of the most promising technologies for multi-stage management which has great potential to solve the above challenges. This paper initially puts forward a scientific concept, in which DT drives the construction of intelligent disaster prevention and mitigation for infrastructure (IDPMI) systematically. To begin with, a scientific review of DT and IDPMI is performed, where the development of DT is summarized and a DT-based life cycle of infrastructures is defined. In addition, the intelligence technologies used in disaster management are key reviewed and their relative merits are illustrated. Furthermore, the development and technical feasibility of DT-driven IDPMI are illustrated by reviewing the relevant practice of DT in infrastructure. In conclusion, a scientific framework of DT-IDPMI is programmed, which not only provides some guidance for the deep integration between DT and IDPMI but also identifies the challenges that inspire the professional community to advance these techniques to address them in future research.},

abstract = {Data mining technology has gradually become an important data analysis and knowledge discovery technology widely used in many modern industries. Data mining is a technique to find its regularity from a large amount of data by analyzing each data. It mainly includes three steps: data preparation, regularity search, and regularity representation. Data preparation is to select the required data from relevant data sources and integrate them into a data set for data mining; regular search is to find out the regularity contained in the data set by a certain method; regular expression is to be as user-readable as possible. The way of understanding (such as visualization) will represent the found patterns. This research mainly discusses the improvement of teaching mode based on digital twin-based education big data mining. Through the research on the basic principles of data mining and digital twin technology, the student evaluation tool module based on digital twin and the relevant data analysis tool module of students based on digital twin education big data mining are developed. Data mining is carried out from the data of student performance, personal basic information, and evaluation information to find the correlation between various factors, find the hidden laws, and provide support for teaching decision-making. This paper also solves the problem of frequent communication with remote databases according to the characteristics of the database data required by students and improves the efficiency and scalability of education big data mining technology based on digital twins. The goal of the virtual interactive system of the digital twin-based CNC platform is to have both three-dimensional real-time monitoring and remote control functions based on a three-dimensional virtual CNC panel. This research integrates the three-dimensional real-time monitoring and remote control of the virtual interactive system, analyzes the system operation process, develops the system interface, and improves the system sub-functions; it builds an experimental environment, conducts example tests on various functions of the digital twin platform virtual interactive system, and performs virtual interactions system performance indicators are analyzed. 60% of students believe that their innovation ability has been improved after the implementation of the digital twin teaching model; 50% of students believe that their self-evaluation ability has been improved. Applying digital twin's educational big data mining to student information management, university teaching evaluation, student performance analysis, and examination system, it has played a very good guiding role in improving the level of school teaching management.},
