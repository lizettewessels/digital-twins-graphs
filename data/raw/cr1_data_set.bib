abstract = {Metaverse (MS) is a digital universe accessible through a virtual environment. It is established through the merging of virtually improved physical and digital reality. Metaverse (MS) offers enhanced immersive experiences and a more interactive learning experience for students in learning and educational settings. It is an expanded and synchronous communication setting that allows different users to share their experiences. The present study aims to evaluate students' perception of the application of MS in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for medical-educational purposes. In this study, 1858 university students were surveyed to examine this model. The study's conceptual framework consisted of adoption constructs including Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Personal innovativeness (PI), Perceived Compatibility (PCO), User Satisfaction (US), Perceived Triability (PTR), and Perceived Observability (POB). The study was unique because the model correlated technology-based features and individual-based features. The study also used hybrid analyses such as Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The present study also employs the Importance Performance Map Analysis (IPMA) to assess the importance and performance factors. The study finds US as an essential determinant of users' intention to use the metaverse (UMS). The present study's finding is useful for stakeholders in the educational sector in understanding the importance of each factor and in making plans based on the order of significance of each factor. The study also methodologically contributes to Information Systems (IS) literature because it is one of the few studies that have used a complementary multi-analytical approach such as ML algorithms to investigate the UMS metaverse systems.},

The purpose of this demonstrative article is to explore the characteristics and influence of 3D tools in the teaching process. The survey is divided into two main formal parts: the first part is the emerging destructive technology trends, including the emergence of technology, mobile devices and innovative digital training scenarios; the second part describes the virtual world as a multi-sensor tool, because the potential provided by the initial scene of virtual reality is used as a training resource in the culture of educational network. Writing is carried out under the explanatory paradigm supported by the viewpoint of qualitative methodology; the technique of calculating reading through heuristics. Similarly, a comprehensive review of printed and digital resources has been carried out, such as books, magazines, dictionaries, papers, online newspapers, web pages, audio-visual document management, illustrations, videos, etc. Finally, the question was raised: to what extent does meta text affect the teaching process based on virtual education background? The development of the whole survey is revealed by combining key words.},

@article{Bibri2022,
abstract = {The emerging phenomenon of platformization has given rise to what has been termed "platform society,“ a digitally connected world where platforms have penetrated the heart of urban societies—transforming social practices, disrupting social interactions and market relations, and affecting democratic processes. One of the recent manifestations of platformization is the Metaverse, a global platform whose data infrastructures, governance models, and economic processes are predicted to penetrate different urban sectors and spheres of urban life. The Metaverse is an idea of a hypothetical set of “parallel virtual worlds” that incarnate ways of living in believably virtual cities as an alternative to future data-driven smart cities. However, this idea has already raised concerns over what constitutes the global architecture of computer mediation underlying the Metaverse with regard to different forms of social life as well as social order. This study analyzes the core emerging trends enabling and driving data-driven smart cities and uses the outcome to devise a novel framework for the digital and computing processes underlying the Metaverse as a virtual form of data-driven smart cities. Further, it examines and discusses the risks and impacts of the Metaverse, paying particular attention to: platformization; the COVID-19 crisis and the ensuing non-spontaneous "normality" of social order; corporate-led technocratic governance; governmentality; privacy, security, and trust; and data governance. A thematic analysis approach is adopted to cope with the vast body of literature of various disciplinarities. The analysis identifies five digital and computing processes related to data-driven smart cities: digital instrumentation, digital hyper-connectivity, datafication, algorithmization, and platformization. The novelty of the framework derived based on thematic analysis lies in its essential processual digital and computing components and the way in which these are structured and integrated given their clear synergies as to enabling the functioning of the Metaverse towards potentially virtual cities. This study highlights how and why the identified digital and computing processes—as intricately interwoven with the entirety of urban ways of living—arouse contentions and controversies pertaining to society' public values. As such, it provides new insights into understanding the complex interplay between the Metaverse as a form of science and technology and the other dimensions of society. Accordingly, it contributes to the scholarly debates in the field of Science, Technology, and Society (STS) by highlighting the societal and ethical implications of the platformization of urban societies through the Metaverse.},

abstract = {The Metaverse represents an always-on 3D network of virtual spaces, designed to facilitate social interaction, learning, collaboration, and a wide range of activities. This emerging computing platform originates from the dynamic convergence of Extended Reality (XR), Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), and platform-mediated everyday life experiences in smart cities. However, the research community faces a pressing challenge in addressing the limitations posed by the resource constraints associated with XR-enabled IoT applications within the Internet of City Things (IoCT). Additionally, there is a limited understanding of the synergies between XR and AIoT technologies in the Metaverse and their implications for IoT applications within this framework. Therefore, this study provides a detailed overview of the literature on the potential applications, opportunities, and challenges pertaining to the deployment of XR technologies in IoT applications within the broader framework of IoCT. The primary focus is on navigating the challenges pertaining to the IoT applications powered by VR and AR as key components of MR in the Metaverse. This study also explores the emerging computing paradigm of AIoT and its synergistic interplay with XR technologies in the Metaverse and in relation to future IoT applications in the realm of IoCT. This study's contributions encompass a comprehensive literature overview of XR technologies in IoT and IoCT, providing a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners. It identifies challenges and resource constraints, identifying areas that require further investigation. It fosters interdisciplinary insights into XR, IoT, AIoT, smart cities, and IoCT, bridging the gap between them. Lastly, it offers innovation pathways for effective XR deployment in future IoT/AIoT applications within IoCT. These contributions collectively advance our understanding of synergistic opportunities and complementary strengths of cutting-edge technologies for advancing the emerging paradigms of urban development.},

Augmented reality (AR) is one of the primary technologies that supports blending digital content with physical environments. However, most AR applications are currently single-user and present significant constraints in terms of time and location. Scaling up the technology to large-sized environments and massively multi-user experiences thus represents one of the primary challenges to achieving such a vision. Due to these constraints, current proposals for the metaverse primarily consist of virtual worlds with little duality between physical and digital. This paper studies the feasibility of a large-scale and persistent AR experience shared among all visitors on our university campus. We define an integrated framework to enable the first AR campus metaverse by considering the nature of the various environments and the available sensing platforms.},

abstract = {Purpose: Many educators are increasingly acquainting themselves and becoming adept with interactive technologies like augmented reality and virtual reality. Some of them are also looking forward to using Metaverse applications, as they want to benefit from its immersive three-dimensional capabilities. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to critically review the extant literature to investigate how, why, where and when the Metaverse can be used for educational purposes. This study also discusses opportunities, challenges and risks related to this disruptive technology. Design/methodology/approach: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses rigorous protocol is used to search, extract, scrutinize and synthesize content from high-impact articles focused on the use of the Metaverse technology in the realms of education. Afterwards, this study theorizes on the costs and benefits of using this interactive technology with students. Findings: A number of researchers are already experimenting with virtual technologies that are very similar to the Metaverse, in different contexts. This research indicates that most students are lured by immersive multi-sensory three-dimensional environments as well as by virtual reality applications that could simulate real-life situations and provide engaging experiences with virtual representations of people, places and objects. On the other hand, this study reveals that educators ought to consider the potential pitfalls of the Metaverse, including privacy breaches and security risks, as well as possible addictions and the development of mental health issues, among others. Practical implications: Students and educators can use the Metaverse to catapult themselves in a simulated digital universe that could reconfigure their sensory inputs, definitions of space, time and points of access to information. This research calls for the development of regulatory instruments, including sound principles, guidelines and procedures that are intended to safeguard and protect Metaverse users. Originality/value: This contribution implies that there is scope for educators to continue developing the Metaverse's virtual spaces to improve their students' motivations, aptitudes and learning outcomes. This study clarifies that the use of the Metaverse in education can create infinite possibilities to enhance their knowledge, competences and abilities through its immersive applications. Yet this paper also raises awareness about possible challenges in the short term as well on other risks associated to the prolonged use of this captivating technology.},

This article aims to describe how the metaverse contributed to university education, and through these factors the success of its application was evidenced. For which a systematic review of the literature was developed. The research is exploratory-descriptive level. A total of 738 documents from the Scopus, ERIC, Taylor & Francis, and Google Scholar databases were reviewed, from which 16 articles were finally extracted. The content analysis technique was used through the Atlas Ti software. With this, it was obtained as a result that the type of metaverse used to a greater extent was virtual reality. Likewise, the areas of study in which they were applied to a greater extent are in education: medicine, engineering and administration. In addition, the factors that evidenced the improvement in university education as an effect of the application of the metaverse are academic performance and interaction between students. It is concluded that, given the pandemic scenario and the need to continue the teaching-learning process considering the limitations offered by the virtual modality in which experiential learning is not developed, it led to the development of learning scenarios through the metaverse. However, it will be necessary to reduce the gaps in terms of teaching skills, create teaching scenarios in the virtual world, use and evaluate them permanently.},

The results indicate that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, and establishing initial trust amongst supply chain partners can drive behavioural intention with respect to metaverse adoption for knowledge sharing to improve supply chain resilience. In addition, sensory feedback is an important characteristic of the metaverse and has a critical influence on adoption behaviour. Moreover, it has a complementary partial mediation effect on the relationship between establishing initial trust amongst supply chain partners and behavioural intention as well as a full mediating effect on the relationship between the initial trust of supply chain partners and behavioural expectations. Finally, sensory feedback moderates the relationship between behavioural intention and expectancy.

abstract = {Metaverse is a vast term that can contain every digital thing in the future. Therefore, life domains, such as learning and education, should have their systems redirected to adopt this topic to keep their availability and longevity. Many papers have discussed the metaverse, the applications to run on, and the historical progress to have the metaverse the way it is today. However, the framework of the metaverse itself is still unclear, and its components cannot be exactly specified. Although E-Learning systems are a need that has developed over the years along with technology, the structures of the available E-Learning systems based on the metaverse are either not well described or are adopted, in their best case, as just a 3D environment. In this paper, we examine some previous works to find out the special technologies that should be provided by the metaverse framework, then we discuss the framework of the metaverse if applied as an E-Learning environment framework. This will make it easy to develop future metaverse-based applications, as the proposed framework will make the virtual learning environments work smoothly on the metaverse. In addition, E-Learning will be a more interactive and pleasant process.},

abstract = {Immersive virtual reality (IVR) and Metaverse applications are gaining attention in the educational field, showing potentials in transforming traditional learning methods by supporting active and experiential forms of learning. Our study, conducted within the context of an Italian university course, employs the Extended Expectation-Confirmation Model (EECM) as a theoretical framework to explore the key aspects of students' acceptance and continued intention to use IVR and Metaverse integrated learning environments in educational settings. The EECM, which bridges the gap between pre-adoption expectations and post-adoption experiences, provides a comprehensive perspective for exploring technology adoption in education. Students' attitudes were assessed before and after they completed an elective course offered by the university that delved into IVR and Metaverse applications. During the course, students explored the theoretical and practical applications of these technologies, engaging in a variety of experiences, from immersive relaxation exercises to immersive educational platforms in the emerging Metaverse. Contrary to common assumptions, pre-adoption factors like performance and effort expectancy had limited impact on expectancy confirmation. However, when students' initial expectations matched their experiences, their perceptions of the technology's usefulness, satisfaction, and confidence in its use were positively enhanced, influencing their continued intention to integrate these tools in education.},

The expected metaverse should be a realistic society with more direct and physical interactions, while the concepts of race, gender, and even physical disability would be weakened, which would be highly beneficial for society. However, the development of metaverse is still in its infancy, with great potential for improvement. Regarding metaverse's huge potential, industry has already come forward with advance preparation, accompanied by feverish investment, but there are few discussions about metaverse in academia to scientifically guide its development. In this paper, we highlight the representative applications for social good. Then we propose a three-layer metaverse architecture from a macro perspective, containing infrastructure, interaction, and ecosystem. Moreover, we journey toward both a historical and novel metaverse with a detailed timeline and table of specific attributes. Lastly, we illustrate our implemented blockchain-driven metaverse prototype of a university campus and discuss the prototype design and insights.},

However, in the last few years, the growth of digital assets and online communications has attracted attention to DTs as highly accurate twins of physical objects. Metaverse, as a digital world, is a concept proposed in 1992 and has also become a popular paradigm and hot topic in public where DTs can play critical roles. This study first presents definitions, applications, and general challenges of DT and Metaverse. It then offers a three-layer architecture linking the physical world to the Metaverse through a user interface. Further, it investigates the security and privacy challenges of using DTs in Metaverse. Finally, a conclusion, including possible solutions for mentioned challenges and future works, will be provided.},

This article provides a detailed analysis and description of higher education institutions' adoption of key underlying metaverse technologies such as virtual meeting space, virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality and digital twins. We analyze multiple case studies of tent HEIs that have incorporated metaverse in their teaching, learning and extra-curricular activities. We have developed seven propositions, which describe some driving forces that potentially exert pressures on higher education institutions to adopt the metaverse and the effects of the metaverse on student engagement and academic performance.},

@article{Ng2022,
abstract = {The term metaverse appeared for the first time in a novel published in 1992. Since the early 2000s, researchers have started to use this term to refer to digital technologies for learners to interact with other users with avatars. The term came to prominence in around 2020 due to the rebranding of Facebook. However, there was no consensus on what kind of technologies should belong to the metaverse and how to conceptualise the term. As such, this paper presents an exploratory review for conceptualising the metaverse based on 19 articles from the Web of Science database. This review focuses on the metaverse trend, how researchers in the past and present conceptualizing the term, and key technologies identified in the metaverse world. The findings identify the major types of technologies used in the metaverse studies and offers a sound theoretical foundation in terms of cognitive, social and teacher presence to understand what future potential of these technologies could bring to online learning. Five major types of technologies are identified which could map to four key elements of the metaverse (i.e., immersion, advanced computing, socialisation, decentralisation). At the end, a model is proposed to connect the key elements of the metaverse and its three presences in the community of inquiry that enhance students' learning outcomes in the metaverse learning environment. Implications for practice or policy: Educators and researchers could rethink what types of technologies belong to the metaverse and how it has the potential to influence the education sector. Instructional designers could create meaningful learning experiences through the four key elements of the metaverse – immersion, advanced computing, socialisation and decentralisation. Policy-makers and educators could refer to the model of metaverse learning environment to guide their future policy and practices.},

@article{Rojas2023,
abstract = {Online learning environments have been widely adopted, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, their usage is envisioned for multiple teaching scenarios, including international courses involving students from different locations. However, as e-learning frameworks lack many advantages of physical interaction, diverse technologies to enhance the learning experience in this regard, including the use of metaverses, are currently in demand. In this study, we implemented an educational metaverse platform for engineering courses at four different European Universities from Poland, Portugal, Germany, and Spain, then had it quantitatively evaluated by students from these higher education institutions. The obtained results illustrate positive student perceptions of its ease of use, satisfaction and fun, and immersion, although their opinions with respect to learning experience and usefulness are less clear. The students seem to agree that interactivity remains insufficient in comparison with face-to-face teaching. For this reason, we provide an examination other related works and finalize this article by suggesting future research directions in the field.},

This is important as the transition from Society 4.0 to Society 5.0 is happening at an exponential pace driven by the Metaverse. Thus, the research question is: how should companies think and do business model innovation in the Society 5.0 / Metaverse space? The method is conceptual, where the business model characteristics of Society 1.0 to 4.0 are empirically stated for inductive arguments for equivalent characteristics of Society 5.0. This is framed with Society 5.0 theory, Metaverse theory, and Osterwalder and Pigneur's nine business model building blocks from their iconic Business Model Canvas (BMC). The contribution is a framework cross-tabulating Society 1.0 to Society 5.0 with the nine BMC elements. Finally, a discussion is provided with findings and implications for managers regarding business model innovation, new businesses, outcome logic, ecospheres, and currencies.},

The advanced virtual and augmented systems coupled with a complex interactive, immersive environment create a metaverse. The metaverse enables us to connect with others in a virtual world free of spatial restrictions and time constraints. In the educational aspect, it allows collaboration among peers and educators in an immersive 3D environment that can imitate the actual classroom setting with learning tools. Metaverse technology enables visualization of virtual 3D structures, facilitates collaboration and small group activities, improves mentor–mentee interactions, provides opportunities for self-directed learning experiences, and helps develop teamwork skills. The metaverse will be adapted rapidly in healthcare, boost digitalization, and grow in use in surgical procedures and medical education. The potential advantages of using the metaverse in diagnosing and treating patients are tremendous.

To cover this gap, this study conducts a systematic literature review of the Metaverse in education. It then applies both content and bibliometric analysis to reveal the research trends, focus, and limitations of this research topic. The obtained findings reveal the research gap in lifelogging applications in educational Metaverse. The findings also show that the design of Metaverse in education has evolved over generations, where generation Z is more targeted with artificial intelligence technologies compared to generation X or Y. In terms of learning scenarios, there have been very few studies focusing on mobile learning, hybrid learning, and micro learning. Additionally, no study focused on using the Metaverse in education for students with disabilities.

abstract = {Online environments, such as metaverses, provide distinct social environments for people to engage in complex, cognitive, and multidirectional learning and meaning-making experiences. These engaging and influential environments highlight important factors associated with the Social Learning Theory (a process through which external settings influence behavior in specific environments). According to this theory, environments provide a space for youth to engage in reciprocal interactions of interpersonal, behavioral, and environmental cues. Online environments designed by social media companies have been scrutinized, given their dependence on algorithms (artificial intelligence systems). Research has revealed the effects of systems that use machine learning to subversively maintain engagement on their platforms for as long as possible. Given the constant changes in socializing environments, younger generational cohorts need to be adequately prepared for systems that determine what type of content they are exposed to, and shape the timing, frequency, and agentic influencers they engage with. Therefore, this article proposes a necessity to expand our understanding about social learning and current technology design principles. This article demonstrates the need for a paradigm shift toward exploring an innovative construct referred to as the digital learning environment. We examine existing issues in the design of digital spaces, provide a positive developmental psychology framework that informs further research, and propose solutions for researchers, educators, policymakers, and caregivers as they navigate healthy technology use and predominant mental health issues in the 21st century.},

abstract = {The metaverse, which is powered by blockchain, artificial intelligence, digital twins, and other cutting-edge intelligent technologies, is a three-dimensional digital space that combines the virtual and the real. It sparks a new technological trend across the globe with great potential in the education. The paper develops the basic framework of the education metaverse on the basis of the concept, technology and theory, investigates its potential application in the teaching of speaking, listening, and interpreting in higher education, and analyzes its prospect from two dimensions of advantages and challenges. The education metaverse helps to foster the innovation of educational modes, ideas, and systems as compared to traditional courses.},

@phdthesis{Wessels2020,
abstract = {The Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) is a complex phenomenon. Its transformative nature holds implications for South African universities, graduate employability and the workplace. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, automation and digital technology, amongst others, have already transformed the world of work. Consequently, mismatches between graduate skills and workplace requirements have emerged which exacerbate the already high levels of unemployment in South Africa. Universities that do not adapt to the speed of innovation will become obsolete. As far as its core function, teaching and learning is concerned, a radical reconsideration of current curricula and pedagogy will be required, including the technological enhancement of teaching and learning practices. This begs the question as to how the key functions of South African universities, particularly those related to teaching and learning, should be transformed to better prepare the future workforce for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.},

abstract = {We argue that Africa has a rightful place in the 4IR. We focus on the higher education sector (universities only), with a specific focus on South Africa. We argue that South African universities stand to benefit from the 4IR. In order to achieve what we term University 4.0, we propose two conceptual models, designated as the macro- and micro-models, as a blueprint for institutional renewal (the macro-model) aligned with the envisaged demands of the 4IR. The micro-model proposes that teaching and learning stand to benefit too. Ideally, both models should be implemented simultaneously to provide the optimum education conditions and preparation for each graduate. Whereas technology is the main driver and anchor of the 4IR, some of the demands of the 4IR can be met by leadership adaptability, staff preparedness and an awareness of the needs of the current and future student population. Therefore, we propose these models as practical and achievable tools to enable Africa's young student population.},

abstract = {The arrival of the Metaverse era provides the possibility for the development of Edu-Metaverse. The Metaverse integrating big data, artificial intelligence, blockchain and other digital technologies can provide individuals with an open and inclusive learning space and teaching space, triggering a new education and teaching reform. Based on this, the paper first defines the educational attributes of the Metaverse, then introduces the application scenarios of the Edu-Metaverse, and finally analyzes the risks faced by the Edu-Metaverse. According to the above, the paper proposes a multi-agent collaborative development strategy: strengthening top-level design at the government level, optimizing resource allocation at the enterprise level, and raising safety awareness at the individual level.},

abstract = {The metaverse, a digital immersive environment in which people interact by using immersive technologies, is shaping a new way for people to interact and socialise. Forecasts predict that by 2026 a quarter of the population will spend at least an hour a day in the metaverse. This projection requires the consideration of several challenges and opportunities that will influence the design of the metaverse. A qualitative ethnographic study with industry experts was carried out to explore the social impact of the metaverse through the lens of inclusion, diversity, equity, accessibility and safety with the goal to identify directions business have to undertake. The results indicated the vast nature of future research questions that will need to be answered and facilitated the creation of good practices for designing an inclusive, accessible, safe metaverse that guarantees equity and diversity. These good practices are a starting point to develop a narrative, spark conversations, brainstorm questions and eventually provide answers for designing a metaverse as a place for people that does not substitute the physical world but complements it.},
