abstract = {Metaverse (MS) is a digital universe accessible through a virtual environment. It is established through the merging of virtually improved physical and digital reality. Metaverse (MS) offers enhanced immersive experiences and a more interactive learning experience for students in learning and educational settings. It is an expanded and synchronous communication setting that allows different users to share their experiences. The present study aims to evaluate students' perception of the application of MS in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for medical-educational purposes. In this study, 1858 university students were surveyed to examine this model. The study's conceptual framework consisted of adoption constructs including Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Personal innovativeness (PI), Perceived Compatibility (PCO), User Satisfaction (US), Perceived Triability (PTR), and Perceived Observability (POB). The study was unique because the model correlated technology-based features and individual-based features. The study also used hybrid analyses such as Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The present study also employs the Importance Performance Map Analysis (IPMA) to assess the importance and performance factors. The study finds US as an essential determinant of users' intention to use the metaverse (UMS). The present study's finding is useful for stakeholders in the educational sector in understanding the importance of each factor and in making plans based on the order of significance of each factor. The study also methodologically contributes to Information Systems (IS) literature because it is one of the few studies that have used a complementary multi-analytical approach such as ML algorithms to investigate the UMS metaverse systems.},

The purpose of this demonstrative article is to explore the characteristics and influence of 3D tools in the teaching process. The survey is divided into two main formal parts: the first part is the emerging destructive technology trends, including the emergence of technology, mobile devices and innovative digital training scenarios; the second part describes the virtual world as a multi-sensor tool, because the potential provided by the initial scene of virtual reality is used as a training resource in the culture of educational network. Writing is carried out under the explanatory paradigm supported by the viewpoint of qualitative methodology; the technique of calculating reading through heuristics. Similarly, a comprehensive review of printed and digital resources has been carried out, such as books, magazines, dictionaries, papers, online newspapers, web pages, audio-visual document management, illustrations, videos, etc. Finally, the question was raised: to what extent does meta text affect the teaching process based on virtual education background? The development of the whole survey is revealed by combining key words.},

@article{Bibri2022,
abstract = {The emerging phenomenon of platformization has given rise to what has been termed "platform society,“ a digitally connected world where platforms have penetrated the heart of urban societies—transforming social practices, disrupting social interactions and market relations, and affecting democratic processes. One of the recent manifestations of platformization is the Metaverse, a global platform whose data infrastructures, governance models, and economic processes are predicted to penetrate different urban sectors and spheres of urban life. The Metaverse is an idea of a hypothetical set of “parallel virtual worlds” that incarnate ways of living in believably virtual cities as an alternative to future data-driven smart cities. However, this idea has already raised concerns over what constitutes the global architecture of computer mediation underlying the Metaverse with regard to different forms of social life as well as social order. This study analyzes the core emerging trends enabling and driving data-driven smart cities and uses the outcome to devise a novel framework for the digital and computing processes underlying the Metaverse as a virtual form of data-driven smart cities. Further, it examines and discusses the risks and impacts of the Metaverse, paying particular attention to: platformization; the COVID-19 crisis and the ensuing non-spontaneous "normality" of social order; corporate-led technocratic governance; governmentality; privacy, security, and trust; and data governance. A thematic analysis approach is adopted to cope with the vast body of literature of various disciplinarities. The analysis identifies five digital and computing processes related to data-driven smart cities: digital instrumentation, digital hyper-connectivity, datafication, algorithmization, and platformization. The novelty of the framework derived based on thematic analysis lies in its essential processual digital and computing components and the way in which these are structured and integrated given their clear synergies as to enabling the functioning of the Metaverse towards potentially virtual cities. This study highlights how and why the identified digital and computing processes—as intricately interwoven with the entirety of urban ways of living—arouse contentions and controversies pertaining to society' public values. As such, it provides new insights into understanding the complex interplay between the Metaverse as a form of science and technology and the other dimensions of society. Accordingly, it contributes to the scholarly debates in the field of Science, Technology, and Society (STS) by highlighting the societal and ethical implications of the platformization of urban societies through the Metaverse.},

abstract = {The Metaverse represents an always-on 3D network of virtual spaces, designed to facilitate social interaction, learning, collaboration, and a wide range of activities. This emerging computing platform originates from the dynamic convergence of Extended Reality (XR), Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), and platform-mediated everyday life experiences in smart cities. However, the research community faces a pressing challenge in addressing the limitations posed by the resource constraints associated with XR-enabled IoT applications within the Internet of City Things (IoCT). Additionally, there is a limited understanding of the synergies between XR and AIoT technologies in the Metaverse and their implications for IoT applications within this framework. Therefore, this study provides a detailed overview of the literature on the potential applications, opportunities, and challenges pertaining to the deployment of XR technologies in IoT applications within the broader framework of IoCT. The primary focus is on navigating the challenges pertaining to the IoT applications powered by VR and AR as key components of MR in the Metaverse. This study also explores the emerging computing paradigm of AIoT and its synergistic interplay with XR technologies in the Metaverse and in relation to future IoT applications in the realm of IoCT. This study's contributions encompass a comprehensive literature overview of XR technologies in IoT and IoCT, providing a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners. It identifies challenges and resource constraints, identifying areas that require further investigation. It fosters interdisciplinary insights into XR, IoT, AIoT, smart cities, and IoCT, bridging the gap between them. Lastly, it offers innovation pathways for effective XR deployment in future IoT/AIoT applications within IoCT. These contributions collectively advance our understanding of synergistic opportunities and complementary strengths of cutting-edge technologies for advancing the emerging paradigms of urban development.},

Augmented reality (AR) is one of the primary technologies that supports blending digital content with physical environments. However, most AR applications are currently single-user and present significant constraints in terms of time and location. Scaling up the technology to large-sized environments and massively multi-user experiences thus represents one of the primary challenges to achieving such a vision. Due to these constraints, current proposals for the metaverse primarily consist of virtual worlds with little duality between physical and digital. This paper studies the feasibility of a large-scale and persistent AR experience shared among all visitors on our university campus. We define an integrated framework to enable the first AR campus metaverse by considering the nature of the various environments and the available sensing platforms.},

abstract = {Purpose: Many educators are increasingly acquainting themselves and becoming adept with interactive technologies like augmented reality and virtual reality. Some of them are also looking forward to using Metaverse applications, as they want to benefit from its immersive three-dimensional capabilities. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to critically review the extant literature to investigate how, why, where and when the Metaverse can be used for educational purposes. This study also discusses opportunities, challenges and risks related to this disruptive technology. Design/methodology/approach: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses rigorous protocol is used to search, extract, scrutinize and synthesize content from high-impact articles focused on the use of the Metaverse technology in the realms of education. Afterwards, this study theorizes on the costs and benefits of using this interactive technology with students. Findings: A number of researchers are already experimenting with virtual technologies that are very similar to the Metaverse, in different contexts. This research indicates that most students are lured by immersive multi-sensory three-dimensional environments as well as by virtual reality applications that could simulate real-life situations and provide engaging experiences with virtual representations of people, places and objects. On the other hand, this study reveals that educators ought to consider the potential pitfalls of the Metaverse, including privacy breaches and security risks, as well as possible addictions and the development of mental health issues, among others. Practical implications: Students and educators can use the Metaverse to catapult themselves in a simulated digital universe that could reconfigure their sensory inputs, definitions of space, time and points of access to information. This research calls for the development of regulatory instruments, including sound principles, guidelines and procedures that are intended to safeguard and protect Metaverse users. Originality/value: This contribution implies that there is scope for educators to continue developing the Metaverse's virtual spaces to improve their students' motivations, aptitudes and learning outcomes. This study clarifies that the use of the Metaverse in education can create infinite possibilities to enhance their knowledge, competences and abilities through its immersive applications. Yet this paper also raises awareness about possible challenges in the short term as well on other risks associated to the prolonged use of this captivating technology.},

This article aims to describe how the metaverse contributed to university education, and through these factors the success of its application was evidenced. For which a systematic review of the literature was developed. The research is exploratory-descriptive level. A total of 738 documents from the Scopus, ERIC, Taylor & Francis, and Google Scholar databases were reviewed, from which 16 articles were finally extracted. The content analysis technique was used through the Atlas Ti software. With this, it was obtained as a result that the type of metaverse used to a greater extent was virtual reality. Likewise, the areas of study in which they were applied to a greater extent are in education: medicine, engineering and administration. In addition, the factors that evidenced the improvement in university education as an effect of the application of the metaverse are academic performance and interaction between students. It is concluded that, given the pandemic scenario and the need to continue the teaching-learning process considering the limitations offered by the virtual modality in which experiential learning is not developed, it led to the development of learning scenarios through the metaverse. However, it will be necessary to reduce the gaps in terms of teaching skills, create teaching scenarios in the virtual world, use and evaluate them permanently.},

The results indicate that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, and establishing initial trust amongst supply chain partners can drive behavioural intention with respect to metaverse adoption for knowledge sharing to improve supply chain resilience. In addition, sensory feedback is an important characteristic of the metaverse and has a critical influence on adoption behaviour. Moreover, it has a complementary partial mediation effect on the relationship between establishing initial trust amongst supply chain partners and behavioural intention as well as a full mediating effect on the relationship between the initial trust of supply chain partners and behavioural expectations. Finally, sensory feedback moderates the relationship between behavioural intention and expectancy.

abstract = {Metaverse is a vast term that can contain every digital thing in the future. Therefore, life domains, such as learning and education, should have their systems redirected to adopt this topic to keep their availability and longevity. Many papers have discussed the metaverse, the applications to run on, and the historical progress to have the metaverse the way it is today. However, the framework of the metaverse itself is still unclear, and its components cannot be exactly specified. Although E-Learning systems are a need that has developed over the years along with technology, the structures of the available E-Learning systems based on the metaverse are either not well described or are adopted, in their best case, as just a 3D environment. In this paper, we examine some previous works to find out the special technologies that should be provided by the metaverse framework, then we discuss the framework of the metaverse if applied as an E-Learning environment framework. This will make it easy to develop future metaverse-based applications, as the proposed framework will make the virtual learning environments work smoothly on the metaverse. In addition, E-Learning will be a more interactive and pleasant process.},

abstract = {Immersive virtual reality (IVR) and Metaverse applications are gaining attention in the educational field, showing potentials in transforming traditional learning methods by supporting active and experiential forms of learning. Our study, conducted within the context of an Italian university course, employs the Extended Expectation-Confirmation Model (EECM) as a theoretical framework to explore the key aspects of students' acceptance and continued intention to use IVR and Metaverse integrated learning environments in educational settings. The EECM, which bridges the gap between pre-adoption expectations and post-adoption experiences, provides a comprehensive perspective for exploring technology adoption in education. Students' attitudes were assessed before and after they completed an elective course offered by the university that delved into IVR and Metaverse applications. During the course, students explored the theoretical and practical applications of these technologies, engaging in a variety of experiences, from immersive relaxation exercises to immersive educational platforms in the emerging Metaverse. Contrary to common assumptions, pre-adoption factors like performance and effort expectancy had limited impact on expectancy confirmation. However, when students' initial expectations matched their experiences, their perceptions of the technology's usefulness, satisfaction, and confidence in its use were positively enhanced, influencing their continued intention to integrate these tools in education.},

The expected metaverse should be a realistic society with more direct and physical interactions, while the concepts of race, gender, and even physical disability would be weakened, which would be highly beneficial for society. However, the development of metaverse is still in its infancy, with great potential for improvement. Regarding metaverse's huge potential, industry has already come forward with advance preparation, accompanied by feverish investment, but there are few discussions about metaverse in academia to scientifically guide its development. In this paper, we highlight the representative applications for social good. Then we propose a three-layer metaverse architecture from a macro perspective, containing infrastructure, interaction, and ecosystem. Moreover, we journey toward both a historical and novel metaverse with a detailed timeline and table of specific attributes. Lastly, we illustrate our implemented blockchain-driven metaverse prototype of a university campus and discuss the prototype design and insights.},

However, in the last few years, the growth of digital assets and online communications has attracted attention to DTs as highly accurate twins of physical objects. Metaverse, as a digital world, is a concept proposed in 1992 and has also become a popular paradigm and hot topic in public where DTs can play critical roles. This study first presents definitions, applications, and general challenges of DT and Metaverse. It then offers a three-layer architecture linking the physical world to the Metaverse through a user interface. Further, it investigates the security and privacy challenges of using DTs in Metaverse. Finally, a conclusion, including possible solutions for mentioned challenges and future works, will be provided.},

This article provides a detailed analysis and description of higher education institutions' adoption of key underlying metaverse technologies such as virtual meeting space, virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality and digital twins. We analyze multiple case studies of tent HEIs that have incorporated metaverse in their teaching, learning and extra-curricular activities. We have developed seven propositions, which describe some driving forces that potentially exert pressures on higher education institutions to adopt the metaverse and the effects of the metaverse on student engagement and academic performance.},

@article{Ng2022,
abstract = {The term metaverse appeared for the first time in a novel published in 1992. Since the early 2000s, researchers have started to use this term to refer to digital technologies for learners to interact with other users with avatars. The term came to prominence in around 2020 due to the rebranding of Facebook. However, there was no consensus on what kind of technologies should belong to the metaverse and how to conceptualise the term. As such, this paper presents an exploratory review for conceptualising the metaverse based on 19 articles from the Web of Science database. This review focuses on the metaverse trend, how researchers in the past and present conceptualizing the term, and key technologies identified in the metaverse world. The findings identify the major types of technologies used in the metaverse studies and offers a sound theoretical foundation in terms of cognitive, social and teacher presence to understand what future potential of these technologies could bring to online learning. Five major types of technologies are identified which could map to four key elements of the metaverse (i.e., immersion, advanced computing, socialisation, decentralisation). At the end, a model is proposed to connect the key elements of the metaverse and its three presences in the community of inquiry that enhance students' learning outcomes in the metaverse learning environment. Implications for practice or policy: Educators and researchers could rethink what types of technologies belong to the metaverse and how it has the potential to influence the education sector. Instructional designers could create meaningful learning experiences through the four key elements of the metaverse – immersion, advanced computing, socialisation and decentralisation. Policy-makers and educators could refer to the model of metaverse learning environment to guide their future policy and practices.},

@article{Rojas2023,
abstract = {Online learning environments have been widely adopted, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, their usage is envisioned for multiple teaching scenarios, including international courses involving students from different locations. However, as e-learning frameworks lack many advantages of physical interaction, diverse technologies to enhance the learning experience in this regard, including the use of metaverses, are currently in demand. In this study, we implemented an educational metaverse platform for engineering courses at four different European Universities from Poland, Portugal, Germany, and Spain, then had it quantitatively evaluated by students from these higher education institutions. The obtained results illustrate positive student perceptions of its ease of use, satisfaction and fun, and immersion, although their opinions with respect to learning experience and usefulness are less clear. The students seem to agree that interactivity remains insufficient in comparison with face-to-face teaching. For this reason, we provide an examination other related works and finalize this article by suggesting future research directions in the field.},

This is important as the transition from Society 4.0 to Society 5.0 is happening at an exponential pace driven by the Metaverse. Thus, the research question is: how should companies think and do business model innovation in the Society 5.0 / Metaverse space? The method is conceptual, where the business model characteristics of Society 1.0 to 4.0 are empirically stated for inductive arguments for equivalent characteristics of Society 5.0. This is framed with Society 5.0 theory, Metaverse theory, and Osterwalder and Pigneur's nine business model building blocks from their iconic Business Model Canvas (BMC). The contribution is a framework cross-tabulating Society 1.0 to Society 5.0 with the nine BMC elements. Finally, a discussion is provided with findings and implications for managers regarding business model innovation, new businesses, outcome logic, ecospheres, and currencies.},

The advanced virtual and augmented systems coupled with a complex interactive, immersive environment create a metaverse. The metaverse enables us to connect with others in a virtual world free of spatial restrictions and time constraints. In the educational aspect, it allows collaboration among peers and educators in an immersive 3D environment that can imitate the actual classroom setting with learning tools. Metaverse technology enables visualization of virtual 3D structures, facilitates collaboration and small group activities, improves mentor–mentee interactions, provides opportunities for self-directed learning experiences, and helps develop teamwork skills. The metaverse will be adapted rapidly in healthcare, boost digitalization, and grow in use in surgical procedures and medical education. The potential advantages of using the metaverse in diagnosing and treating patients are tremendous.

To cover this gap, this study conducts a systematic literature review of the Metaverse in education. It then applies both content and bibliometric analysis to reveal the research trends, focus, and limitations of this research topic. The obtained findings reveal the research gap in lifelogging applications in educational Metaverse. The findings also show that the design of Metaverse in education has evolved over generations, where generation Z is more targeted with artificial intelligence technologies compared to generation X or Y. In terms of learning scenarios, there have been very few studies focusing on mobile learning, hybrid learning, and micro learning. Additionally, no study focused on using the Metaverse in education for students with disabilities.

abstract = {Online environments, such as metaverses, provide distinct social environments for people to engage in complex, cognitive, and multidirectional learning and meaning-making experiences. These engaging and influential environments highlight important factors associated with the Social Learning Theory (a process through which external settings influence behavior in specific environments). According to this theory, environments provide a space for youth to engage in reciprocal interactions of interpersonal, behavioral, and environmental cues. Online environments designed by social media companies have been scrutinized, given their dependence on algorithms (artificial intelligence systems). Research has revealed the effects of systems that use machine learning to subversively maintain engagement on their platforms for as long as possible. Given the constant changes in socializing environments, younger generational cohorts need to be adequately prepared for systems that determine what type of content they are exposed to, and shape the timing, frequency, and agentic influencers they engage with. Therefore, this article proposes a necessity to expand our understanding about social learning and current technology design principles. This article demonstrates the need for a paradigm shift toward exploring an innovative construct referred to as the digital learning environment. We examine existing issues in the design of digital spaces, provide a positive developmental psychology framework that informs further research, and propose solutions for researchers, educators, policymakers, and caregivers as they navigate healthy technology use and predominant mental health issues in the 21st century.},

abstract = {The Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) is a complex phenomenon. Its transformative nature holds implications for South African universities, graduate employability and the workplace. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, automation and digital technology, amongst others, have already transformed the world of work. Consequently, mismatches between graduate skills and workplace requirements have emerged which exacerbate the already high levels of unemployment in South Africa. Universities that do not adapt to the speed of innovation will become obsolete. As far as its core function, teaching and learning is concerned, a radical reconsideration of current curricula and pedagogy will be required, including the technological enhancement of teaching and learning practices. This begs the question as to how the key functions of South African universities, particularly those related to teaching and learning, should be transformed to better prepare the future workforce for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.},

We argue that South African universities stand to benefit from the 4IR. In order to achieve what we term University 4.0, we propose two conceptual models, designated as the macro- and micro-models, as a blueprint for institutional renewal (the macro-model) aligned with the envisaged demands of the 4IR. The micro-model proposes that teaching and learning stand to benefit too. Ideally, both models should be implemented simultaneously to provide the optimum education conditions and preparation for each graduate. Whereas technology is the main driver and anchor of the 4IR, some of the demands of the 4IR can be met by leadership adaptability, staff preparedness and an awareness of the needs of the current and future student population. Therefore, we propose these models as practical and achievable tools to enable Africa's young student population.},

Forecasts predict that by 2026 a quarter of the population will spend at least an hour a day in the metaverse. This projection requires the consideration of several challenges and opportunities that will influence the design of the metaverse. A qualitative ethnographic study with industry experts was carried out to explore the social impact of the metaverse through the lens of inclusion, diversity, equity, accessibility and safety with the goal to identify directions business have to undertake. The results indicated the vast nature of future research questions that will need to be answered and facilitated the creation of good practices for designing an inclusive, accessible, safe metaverse that guarantees equity and diversity. These good practices are a starting point to develop a narrative, spark conversations, brainstorm questions and eventually provide answers for designing a metaverse as a place for people that does not substitute the physical world but complements it.},

abstract = {Robotics and automation have been a growing area within K–12 educational institutions for the past decade. Across secondary educational institutions, students are introduced to robotics in classes, after-school clubs, and competition leagues through various educational platforms, vendors, and kits. Robotics was initially implemented in schools to help drive more interest in STEM through hands-on application of mechanical, electrical, structural, and computer engineering concepts. Recently, the trend of K–12 robotics has become very niche, focusing more on mobile robotics or robotics competitions. Because of this trend, students have limited exposure to emerging technological advances, such as those found in Industry 4.0. Exciting technological areas, such as digital twins, are not covered in curricula, and this lack of exposure negatively influences the direction of student interest in the “T” and “E” of STEM, with many students never pursuing computer science, technology, or robotics in higher education. The primary goal of this research is to provide a methodology to expose secondary students to Industry 4.0 technologies by leveraging accessible technologies, such as Unity and the Robot Operating System (ROS), to develop a low-cost, high-fidelity digital twin of a pick-and-place robot in a smart warehouse operation. This digital twin prototype will help students to learn about Industry 4.0 trends, such as next-generation automation systems, digital twins, digital manufacturing, intelligent automation, and additive manufacturing, using ROS–Unity integration and hardware accessible to secondary schools to simulate a pick-and-place robotic application. By harnessing the accessibility of Unity and ROS to create a low-cost digital twin prototype for a secondary school, this research has a secondary goal of improving the pipeline of students interested in pursuing STEM-related learning in higher education, thereby ensuring a future STEM workforce that can research, design, develop, operate, and maintain the systems and technologies of Industry 4.0.},

The increase in the application of DT technology across many industries has prompted the call for greater exploration of the possibilities for DTs in education along with a consideration of the challenges to their implementation. There are also questions being raised about the opportunity to develop DTs of learners to extend the use of data to inform learning and teaching, which has been boosted by the recent rise of learning analytics and educational data mining. In this paper we will explore what DT technology is and offer a new definition of DTs that can be used in the educational context. Current uses and the potential future applications will be explored, as well as consideration of what is necessary to build DTs of learners (and educators). The use of DT technology also poses many challenges due to the complexity of DT design and application, and these will be outlined. The paper concludes with a discussion of future directions and areas where more research is needed to fully explore the potential of DT for higher education.},

abstract = {Recent technological developments and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled sophisticated capabilities to be a part of digital twins (DTs), virtually making it possible to introduce automation into all aspects ofwork processes. Given these possibilities that DT can offer, practitioners are facing increasingly difficult decisions regarding what capabilities to select when deploying a DT in practice. The lack of research in this field has not helped. It has resulted in the rebranding and reuse of emerging technological capabilities such as prediction, simulation, AI, and machine learning (ML) as necessary constituents of DT. Inappropriate selection of capabilities in a DT can result in missed opportunities, strategic misalignments, inflated expectations, and the risk of it being rejected as hype by the practitioners. To alleviate this challenge, this paper proposes a digitalization framework, designed and developed by following a design science research (DSR) methodology over a period of 18 months. The framework can help practitioners select an appropriate level of sophistication in a DT by weighing the pros and cons for each level, determining evaluation criteria for the digital twin system, and assessing the implications of the selected DT on the organizational processes and strategies and value creation. Three real-life case studies illustrated the application and usefulness of the framework.},

abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) technology is far from being comprehensive and mature, resulting in their piecemeal implementation in practice where some functions are automated by DTs, and others are still performed by humans. This piecemeal implementation of DTs often leaves practitioners wondering what roles (or functions) to allocate to DTs in a work system, and how might it impact humans. A lack of knowledge about the roles that humans and DTs play in a work system can result in significant costs, misallocation of resources, unrealistic expectations from DTs, and strategic misalignments. To alleviate this challenge, this paper answers the research question: When humans work with DTs, what types of roles can a DT play, and to what extent can those roles be automated? Specifically, we propose a two-dimensional conceptual framework, Levels of Digital Twin (LoDT). The framework is an integration of the types of roles a DT can play, broadly categorized under (1) Observer, (2) Analyst, (3) Decision Maker, and (4) Action Executor, and the extent of automation for each of these roles, divided into five different levels ranging from completely manual to fully automated. A particular DT can play any number of roles at varying levels. The framework can help practitioners systematically plan DT deployments, clearly communicate goals and deliverables, and lay out a strategic vision. A case study illustrates the usefulness of the framework.},

MGDTs provide a powerful tool to manage the huge historical data and real-time data stream in an efficient and secure manner and support MGs' operation by assisting in their design, operation management, and maintenance. In this paper, the concept of the digital twin (DT) and its key characteristics are introduced. Moreover, a workflow for establishing MGDTs is presented. The goal is to explore different applications of DTs in MGs, namely in design, control, operator training, forecasting, fault diagnosis, expansion planning, and policy-making. Besides, an up-to-date overview of studies that applied the DT concept to power systems and specifically MGs is provided. Considering the significance of situational awareness, security, and resilient operation for MGs, their potential enhancement in light of digital twinning is thoroughly analyzed and a conceptual model for resilient operation management of MGs is presented. Finally, future trends in MGDTs are discussed.},

The project #ko.vernetzt supports the educational organization Kolping-Bildungswerk Paderborn in the process of digital transformation. In this article it is presented and reflected from a practice-oriented media educational perspective. The outlined qualification measures are intended to ensure sustainable development in the context of digitization for both employees and the organization itself. The processes that are presented here are viewed from the perspectives of the organization and from the viewpoint of its employees. Media education and the transfer of work-related digital competences are equally of great importance in this respect. Insights from this project can be viewed in the greater discourse and eventually applied to other contexts. The work with Kolping-Bildungswerk Paderborn and all partners involved clearly shows that a successful digitization strategy must include the participation of all stakeholders and should always be viewed from the human perspective first.},

abstract = {Sustainable development was defined by the UN in 1987 as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, and this is a core concept in this paper. This work acknowledges the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e., economic, social, and environmental, but its focus is on this last one. A digital twin (DT) is frequently described as a physical entity with a virtual counterpart, and the data, connections between the two, implying the existence of connectors and blocks for efficient and effective data communication. This paper provides a meta systematic literature review (SLR) (i.e., an SLR of SLRs) regarding the sustainability requirements of DT-based systems. Numerous papers on the subject of DT were also selected because they cited the analyzed SLRs and were considered relevant to the purposes of this research. From the selection and analysis of 29 papers, several limitations and challenges were identified: the perceived benefits of DTs are not clearly understood; DTs across the product life cycle or the DT life cycle are not sufficiently studied; it is not clear how DTs can contribute to reducing costs or supporting decision-making; technical implementation of DTs must be improved and better integrated in the context of the IoT; the level of fidelity of DTs is not entirely evaluated in terms of their parameters, accuracy, and level of abstraction; and the ownership of data stored within DTs should be better understood. Furthermore, from our research, it was not possible to find a paper discussing DTs only in regard to environmental sustainability.},

Digital twin is one of the enabling technologies that link actual physical system with its virtual depiction using advanced digital technologies. In order to leverage its potential, firms have instigated to adopt digital twin and physical internet for real-world applications. Although researches on impact of information technology in supply chains exists, a study on the modelling aspects by analysing critical success factors for adoption of digital twin and physical internet is limited. We have addressed this gap by developing a structural model for identifying the inter-relationships and cause effect parameters of critical success factors for adoption of digital twin and physical internet. Thirteen critical success factors were shortlisted based on literature review and in consultation with experts. An integrated Grey- based, decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)is used to visualize the causal relationships among critical success factors and verified by applying the proposed model in an electronics manufacturing firm. Sensitivity analysis has been done to check accuracy of results and robustness of the study. The results reveal that top management commitment and support and long, medium and short term planning are the most influential factors impacting the adoption of digital twin and physical internet in electronics industry. Findings of this research provide insights for supply chain managers and academicians by identifying the cause and effect group critical success factors for effective adoption of digital twin and physical internet.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers. Amid the rapid development of information communication technologies (ICTs), residents of future smart cities are expected to be exposed to unprecedented amounts of real-Time information on a daily basis. The cognitive overload driven by an excess of complex information has become a potential issue. Nonetheless, standardized information systems are still widely used, despite individual differences in information intake. To set a foundation for the intelligent information systems of smart cities, this paper introduces methods and tools for a cognition-driven, personalized information system, which acknowledges individual differences in information preference and helps reduce the cognitive load in daily lives and at work. The proposed method includes the use of virtual reality (VR) to simulate complex tasks paired with the digital twin modeling of workers' cognitive reactions to different information formats and contents in VR simulation. Collected data are then used to build a personal digital twins model of information-driven cognition, or Cog-DT. A human subject experiment was performed with a simulated industrial facility shutdown maintenance task as a proof of concept of Cog-DT. The latest neuroimaging technology and analysis methods were applied to model unique cognitive processes pertaining to information processing. Results indicate that cognitive activities driven by different information stimuli in the work context are distinguishable and modelable with Cog-DT methods and tools. This study is expected to contribute to digital twin literature by testing a human-centered, individual-level digital twin modeling method of cognitive activities. It also sets a preliminary foundation for developing personalized information systems for the smart cities of the future.},

DT is a key enabler for Industry 4.0, especially on the digitalization and visualization processes. Even though the idea of DT has been defined thoroughly throughout the recent years, there are still many different interpretations which are the result of different viewpoints of the involved professionals. The digitalization process requires huge amounts of data, which is generated, collected, handled and processed by various sources as well as digital twins themselves, thus offering new challenges that need to be addressed. In this paper, we attempt to i) assess the current state of digital twins, ii) describe the terms digital model and digital shadow as they are often misused as synonyms and iii) review the concepts of Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0 and discuss how these are connected.

Given the inviting idea behind a digital twin which allows the efficient exploitation and utilization of simulations such a trend is understandable. The purpose of this paper is to use a scientometrics approach to study the early publication history of the digital twin across academia. Our analysis is based on large-scale bibliographic and citation data from Scopus that provides authoritative information about high-quality publications in essentially all fields of science, engineering and humanities. This paper has four major objectives. First, we obtain a global overview of all publications related to a digital twin across all major subject areas. This analysis provides insights into the structure of the entire publication corpus. Second, we investigate the co-occurrence of subject areas appearing together on publications. This reveals interdisciplinary relations of the publications and identifies the most collaborative fields. Third, we conduct a trend and keyword analysis to gain insights into the evolution of the concept and the importance of keywords. Fourth, based on results from topic modeling using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model we introduce the definition of a scientometric dimension (SD) of digital twin research that allows to summarize an important aspect of the bound diversity of the academic literature.},

These seemingly distinct technologies are currently coalescing into an encompassing new technology called the digital twin. This technology allows innovative firms to create a digital replica of a physical entity that evolves over its life cycle. This article explores the implications of the digital twin for innovation theory and practice. First, we examine the connection between the digital twin and three related technologies (i.e., 3D printing, big data, and AI). Second, we create a typology of four categories of digital twins (i.e., monitoring, making, enhancing, and replicating) and illustrate their relevance for innovation management. Third, we offer a set of four case studies that exemplify this typology and illustrate how digital twins have been put into practice. Fourth, we craft a set of digital twin-related future research directions that encompasses a broad range of innovation-related topics, including service innovation, co-creation, and product design. We hope that our examination of the digital twin serves as a catalyst to help advance innovation thought and practice in this intriguing new domain.},

abstract = {Engineering education providers should foresee the potential of digital transformation of teaching and skill-developing activities so that graduating engineers can find themselves highly aligned with the demands and attributes needed by prospective industrial employers. The advancement of industrial revolutions towards hybridisation of the enabling technologies recognised by Industry 4.0, Society 5.0, and Industry 5.0 have transformed the components of the engineering higher education system remarkably. Future workforce requirements will demand an employee's multidisciplinary skill mix and other professional qualities. Implementing human-centric decision-making based on insights from the Digital Twin (DT) systems, sustainability, and lean systems is necessary for further economic growth. Recent barriers identified by the Australian Council of Engineering Deans, the development of teaching capabilities, and affordable and digitally transformed learning facilities by education providers were all considered. This paper explores the role of Digital Twins (DTs) in enhancing engineering higher education by incorporating Industry 4.0 components and other industrial advances. By reviewing curricula, pedagogy, and the evolving skill requirements for engineering graduates, this study identifies key benefits of DTs, such as cost-effectiveness, resource management, and immersive learning experiences. This paper also outlines challenges in implementing DT-based labs, including IT infrastructure, data quality, privacy, and security issues. The findings indicate that engineering education should embrace DTs to foster multidisciplinary skills and human-centric decision-making to meet future workforce demands. Collaboration with industry is highlighted as a crucial factor in the successful transformation of teaching practices and in offering real-world experiences. The COVID-19 pandemic has expedited the adoption of DT technologies, demonstrating their utility in minimising educational disruptions. While this paper acknowledges the high potential of DTs to prepare engineering students for future industry demands, it also emphasises the need for professional development among educators to ensure effective and balanced implementation.},

Together with these innovative techniques, the concept of circular economy and its relevant tools such as life cycle costing, life cycle impact assessment, materials passports, and circularity measurements have been implemented in a number of sectors in different countries for the transition from a linear “take, make, and dispose” model towards a more circular model, which has shown positive results for the environment and economy. In this article, with the help of implementation, prototyping, and case studies, we explore how these technological advancements and innovative techniques are used in different sectors such as information and communications technology, the built environment, mining and manufacturing, education, healthcare, the public sectors, and others to provide an opportunity to understand and resolve the agreed upon framework in 2015 by 193 countries, that is, the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.},

As a digital replica of a physical entity, the basis of DT is the infrastructure and data, the core is the algorithm and model, and the application is the software and service. The grounding of DT and AI in industrial sectors is even more dependent on the systematic and in-depth integration of domain-specific expertise. This survey comprehensively reviews over 300 manuscripts on AI-driven DT technologies of Industry 4.0 used over the past five years and summarizes their general developments and the current state of AI-integration in the fields of smart manufacturing and advanced robotics. These cover conventional sophisticated metal machining and industrial automation as well as emerging techniques, such as 3D printing and human–robot interaction/cooperation. Furthermore, advantages of AI-driven DTs in the context of sustainable development are elaborated. Practical challenges and development prospects of AI-driven DTs are discussed with a respective focus on different levels. A route for AI-integration in multiscale/fidelity DTs with multiscale/fidelity data sources in Industry 4.0 is outlined.},

abstract = {The move towards advanced manufacturing and Industry 4.0 is fed by increased demand for speeding up innovation, increasing flexibility, improving maintenance, and becoming more customized while saving on the total cost of operations. This is accompanied by increased dependence on virtual product and process development, data‐driven processes, and product knowledge. Other characteristics, affecting modern design, include big data intelligence in product, process, and maintenance. New technologies that empower data analytics include added manufacturing, flexible manufacturing, robotics, sensor technology, smart value/supply chains, and industrial information backbones. This paper is about surrogate models, also called digital twins , that provide an important complementary capacity to physical assets. Digital twins capture past, present, and predicted behavior of physical assets. Digital twin models are updated periodically to represent the current state of physical assets. This distinguishes digital twins from conventional simulations in that sensor data can continuously feed them. The type of curated information on the state of physical asset's history depends on how digital twins are used. For example, if a digital twin is used for fault classification, the history captured is operational data from equipment in healthy and faulty states. We provide here a review of digital twins, with an emphasis on Industry 4.0 applications.},

This study focuses on the preconditions and benefits related to developing new ecosystem-based services around digital twins. As the digital twin business ecosystem is very complex and the goal of the research was to gain an in-depth knowledge in this field, the empirical evidence builds on qualitative data gathered from six case companies in the manufacturing sector. The results show that at the individual company level, the emergence of the ecosystems is determined by goal orientation and willingness to share information. The expected benefits are related to effective resource utilization, possibilities for co-learning, and new business creation. At the ecosystem level, forming a digital twin business ecosystem requires technical receptivity and common interests and goals among the members, as well as a strong customer-centric approach. At its best, a digital twin business ecosystem provides inter-organizational value for its members. This study provides new insights into developing new ecosystem-based services related to digital twins, both from the service provider and utilizer viewpoints. Further studies could broaden the implications by testing the relationships between specific preconditions and benefits at the company and ecosystem levels.},

Digital Twin (DT), a collective representation of active and passive captured data, is a virtual counterpart of the physical resources that could help prevent effective preventive maintenance in any applied domain. Currently, lots of research is going on about the applicability of digital twin in smart IOT based manufacturing industry 4.0 environment. Still, it lacks a formal study, which can provide a bird's eye view about the research efforts and directions. In this paper, the authors represent a bibliometric survey of the digital twin concept based on the Scopus database to present a global view about scholars' contributions in the manufacturing area. The study was conducted by retrieving 844 Scopus research papers published from 2015-2020 and analysed to find out critical insights such as publication volume, co-authorship networks, citation analysis, and demographic research distribution. The study revealed that significant contribution is made via concept propositions in conferences and some papers published in the journal. However, there is a scope of lots of research work in the direction of actual and secure digital twin implementation.},

To study the status of the application of digital twins in the combination with AI, this paper classifies the applications and prospects of AI in digital twins by studying the research results of the current published literature. We discuss the application status of digital twins in the four areas of aerospace, intelligent manufacturing in production workshops, unmanned vehicles, and smart city transportation, and we review the current challenges and topics that need to be looked forward to in the future. It was found that the integration of digital twins and AI has significant effects in aerospace flight detection simulation, failure warning, aircraft assembly, and even unmanned flight. In the virtual simulation test of automobile autonomous driving, it can save 80% of the time and cost, and the same road conditions reduce the parameter scale of the actual vehicle dynamics model and greatly improve the test accuracy. In the intelligent manufacturing of production workshops, the establishment of a virtual workplace environment can provide timely fault warning, extend the service life of the equipment, and ensure the overall workshop operational safety. In smart city traffic, the real road environment is simulated, and traffic accidents are restored, so that the traffic situation is clear and efficient, and urban traffic management can be carried out quickly and accurately. Finally, we looked forward to the future of digital twins and AI, hoping to provide a reference for future research in related fields.},

abstract = {Digital Twins (DTs) are one of the disruptive technologies associated with the Industry 4.0 concept. A DT connects the physical manufacturing system with the digital cyberspace, via the synchronization of the simulation (i.e., physical configurations) and data models (i.e., product, process, and resource models) of the manufacturing system. This synchronization of both worlds—the physical and digital—allows one to address the issue of manufacturing customized products. This challenge of mass customization (1) puts forward the goal of achieving the highest level of customer satisfaction, and (2) creates the need for the optimization of the complete value creation process. Within an Industry 4.0 context, the latter is translated as the interlinking of production resources and systems, via a DT, as it is in the physical world where the actual value-creation process takes place. The success of an Industry 4.0 mass customization environment (or mass customization 4.0), depends on its degree/level of sustainability. For these reasons, the present paper presents a review of relevant concepts related to the role of DTs in the achievement of a mass customization 4.0 environment, plus some proposals of how to address the identified research challenges.

abstract = {Digital Twins have been described as beneficial in many areas, such as virtual commissioning, fault prediction or reconfiguration planning. Equipping Digital Twins with artificial intelligence functionalities can greatly expand those beneficial applications or open up altogether new areas of application, among them cross-phase industrial transfer learning. In the context of machine learning, transfer learning represents a set of approaches that enhance learning new tasks based upon previously acquired knowledge. Here, knowledge is transferred from one lifecycle phase to another in order to reduce the amount of data or time needed to train a machine learning algorithm. Looking at common challenges in developing and deploying industrial machinery with deep learning functionalities, embracing this concept would offer several advantages: Using an intelligent Digital Twin, learning algorithms can be designed, configured and tested in the design phase before the physical system exists and real data can be collected. Once real data becomes available, the algorithms must merely be fine-tuned, significantly speeding up commissioning and reducing the probability of costly modifications. Furthermore, using the Digital Twin's simulation capabilities virtually injecting rare faults in order to train an algorithm's response or using reinforcement learning, e.g. to teach a robot, become practically feasible. This article presents several cross-phase industrial transfer learning use cases utilizing intelligent Digital Twins. A real cyber physical production system consisting of an automated welding machine and an automated guided vehicle equipped with a robot arm is used to illustrate the respective benefits.},

Here we present a particular type of digital twin that involves a combination of computer vision, scientific machine learning, and augmented reality. This novel digital twin is able, therefore, to see, to interpret what it sees—and, if necessary, to correct the model it is equipped with—and presents the resulting information in the form of augmented reality. The computer vision capabilities allow the twin to receive data continuously. As any other digital twin, it is equipped with one or more models so as to assimilate data. However, if persistent deviations from the predicted values are found, the proposed methodology is able to correct on the fly the existing models, so as to accommodate them to the measured reality. Finally, the suggested methodology is completed with augmented reality capabilities so as to render a completely new type of digital twin. These concepts are tested against a proof-of-concept model consisting on a nonlinear, hyperelastic beam subjected to moving loads whose exact position is to be determined.},

abstract = {Innovative solutions targeting improvements in the behavior of energy consumers will be required to achieve desired efficiency in the use of energy. Among other measures for stimulating consumers' behavior changes based on attention triggers, personalized recommendations are essential to enhance sustainable progress towards energy efficiency. In light of this challenge, the current study focuses on innovative energy services that are based on intelligent recommendation systems and digital twins. We review several trends associated with the modeling and diffusion of energy services, taking into account the positive interrelationships existing between recommendation provisions and demand-side consumer energy behavior. This is achieved by means of a content analysis of the state-of-the-art works, focusing on the IEEE Xplore and Scopus databases. Based on this review, we present new empirical evidence to validate data-driven twin technologies as novel ways of implementing consumer-oriented demand-side management via sophisticated abstraction of consumers energy behaviors, and identify various barriers associated with the adoption of energy services, especially as they relate to the implementation and overall adoption of the digital-twins concept. Lastly, we use the review to summarize a coherent policy recommendations related to the wide-spread adoption of the digital-twins concept, and demand-side management solutions in general.},

abstract = {The17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established by the United Nations Agenda 2030 constitute a global blueprint agenda and instrument for peace and prosperity worldwide. Artificial intelligence and other digital technologies that have emerged in the last years, are being currently applied in virtually every area of society, economy and the environment. Hence, it is unsurprising that their current role in the pursuance or hampering of the SDGs has become critical. This study aims at providing a snapshot and comprehensive view of the progress made and prospects in the relationship between artificial intelligence technologies and the SDGs. A comprehensive review of existing literature has been firstly conducted, after which a series SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analyses have been undertaken to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats inherent to artificial intelligence-driven technologies as facilitators or barriers to each of the SDGs. Based on the results of these analyses, a subsequent broader analysis is provided, from a position vantage, to (i) identify the efforts made in applying AI technologies in SDGs, (ii) pinpoint opportunities for further progress along the current decade, and (iii) distill ongoing challenges and target areas for important advances. The analysis is organized into six categories or perspectives of human needs: life, economic and technological development, social development, equality, resources and natural environment. Finally, a closing discussion is provided about the prospects, key guidelines and lessons learnt that should be adopted for guaranteeing a positive shift of artificial intelligence developments and applications towards fully supporting the SDGs attainment by 2030.},

abstract = {Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have facilitated continuous improvement in smart city based applications such as smart healthcare, transportation, and environmental management. Digital Twin (DT) is an AI-based virtual replica of the real-world physical entity. DTs have been successfully adopted in manufacturing and industrial sectors, they are however still at the early stage in smart city based applications. The major reason for this lag is the lack of trust and privacy issues in sharing sensitive data. Federated Learning (FL) is a technology that could be integrated along with DT to ensure privacy preservation and trustworthiness. This paper focuses on the integration of these two promising technologies for adoption in real-time and life-critical scenarios, as well as for ease of governance in smart city based applications. We present an extensive survey on the various smart city based applications of FL models in DTs. Based on the study, some prominent challenges and future directions are presented for better FL–DT integration in future applications.},

abstract = {The notions of smart construction and smart or digital cities include many modern concepts that are advocated today, especially in countries with advanced economies, and depend on using information technology and the Internet of Things as a basis to automate processes and activate digital systems to manage activities and services related to the operation of buildings and urban structures. In light of the spread of digital technology and modern managerial approaches, the concept of a digital twin is being used on a large scale with the current trend and direction to digitalize activities providing many economic, social and technical advantages. A digital twin is a system in which a virtual representation of a real entity or physical system is used continuously by being fed with data and deriving outputs in the form of decisions and actions that are generated through the processes of machine learning, simulation, development and lifecycle management. This study aims to review the literature on construction project management through the lens of digital twins and ways to use them in the field to improve operational results. The authors propose a framework for analyzing and supervising the development of digital twins that uses three main stages: the commonly encountered Building Information Modeling (BIM); the existing monitoring and actuation digital twins; and an envisioned third stage that makes use of artificial intelligence, complex visualization instruments and advanced controls with the capability to exact change within a construction project on the building site.},

@article{Sharma2022,
abstract = {Digital Twin was introduced over a decade ago, as an innovative all-encompassing tool, with perceived benefits including real-time monitoring, simulation, optimisation and accurate forecasting. However, the theoretical framework and practical implementations of digital twin (DT) are yet to fully achieve this vision at scale. Although an increasing number of successful implementations exist in research and industrial works, sufficient implementation details are not publicly available, making it difficult to fully assess their components and effectiveness, to draw comparisons, identify successful solutions, share lessons, and thus to jointly advance and benefit from the DT methodology. This work first presents a review of relevant DT research and industrial works, focusing on the key DT features, current approaches in different domains, and successful DT implementations, to infer the key DT components and properties, and to identify current limitations and reasons behind the delay in the widespread implementation and adoption of digital twin. This work identifies that the major reasons for this delay are: the fact the DT is still a fast evolving concept; the lack of a universal DT reference framework, e.g. DT standards are scarce and still evolving; problem- and domain-dependence; security concerns over shared data; lack of DT performance metrics; and reliance of digital twin on other fast-evolving technologies. Advancements in machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT) and big data have led to significant improvements in DT features such as real-time monitoring and accurate forecasting. Despite this progress and individual company-based efforts, certain research and implementation gaps exist in the field, which have so far prevented the widespread adoption of the DT concept and technology; these gaps are also discussed in this work. Based on reviews of past work and the identified gaps, this work then defines a conceptualisation of DT which includes its components and properties; these also validate the uniqueness of DT as a concept, when compared to similar concepts such as simulation, autonomous systems and optimisation. Real-life case studies are used to showcase the application of the conceptualisation. This work discusses the state-of-the-art in DT, addresses relevant and timely DT questions, and identifies novel research questions, thus contributing to a better understanding of the DT paradigm and advancing the theory and practice of DT and its allied technologies.},

abstract = {The scientific discussion on the Digital Twin gained substantial momentum within the last couple of years. In the context of Industry 4.0, the Digital Twin in the broadest sense refers to the concept of a coupled virtual representation of a physical asset. The asset types may range from products and processes to whole production systems. Different authors offer a variety of interpretations on the actual nature of the Digital Twin, often defining it via implicit functional aspects rather than giving explicit definitions. At the same time, some authors use the term merely as a catchphrase, thus applying blur to this emerging paradigm. At this point, a comprehensive understanding as well as a unifying model of the Digital Twin are absent. This paper therefore provides a structured review of the body of relevant literature with the specific focus on finding explicit definitions of the term "Digital Twin"as well as stated models characterizing the Digital Twin concept. As a result, a relevance assessment provides the most important literature regarding the research questions. The found explicit definitions, being partly conflicting, are presented. Similar notions like Product Avatar and Digital Shadow are assorted accordingly. Further, depictions of Digital Twin models stated in the most relevant literature as well as derived Digital Twin purposes are provided. Thus, this paper extends the theoretical foundation, thereby setting a basis for future augmented Digital Twin modeling.},

abstract = {The current technology push towards Industry 4.0 has provoked companies to gather exponential larger amounts of data. The sheer amount of data, as well as the implicit and explicit interrelations have increased the organisational complexity. As a result, companies lose control, have difficulties in reaching decisions, while unknowingly creating information and knowledge gaps - irrespective of the abundance of data available. Digital twinning technology can be instrumental to this problem. The technology allows for reasoning from the information content, bringing together the current situation and the expected course of process, while simultaneously aiming to predict future possibilities based on the information content. To achieve an effective and efficient implementation of digital twinning technology a purpose-driven approach is proposed. An approach towards defining the purpose can be facilitated by following the 3P characterisation: Purpose, Perspective and Priority. The incorporation of the 3P characterisation will lead information provision that is derived from the defined purpose. This can also be called purpose-driven information management. In this paper two projects are explained that will be used as use-cases to evaluate and validate the theory of purpose-driven information management and the 3P characterisation.},

With increasing stress on healthcare systems, it has become crucial to explore the latest and cost-effective solutions that can provide fast and reliable medical services. The focus of this study, therefore, is to explore applications of metaverse in various health care systems and elaborate on how it can efficiently improve the clinical management of patients. Consequently, an in-depth assessment of the metaverse has been carried out, while covering its core fundamentals, key technologies, and diverse applications in healthcare and medicine, including but not limited to, emergency response learning, hands-on experience in anatomy learning, orthopaedics, paediatrics and so on. To carry out the study, we have used an exploratory approach to analyze qualitative data on healthcare metaverse services in our systematic review. Relevant articles from scientific databases such as Web of Science, Springer, Scopus, and IEEE have been identified, and the analysis has been conducted using the PRISMA reporting guideline to ensure transparent and comprehensive reporting. The results of the study suggest that the metaverse has the potential to transform healthcare systems by introducing novel methods for delivering healthcare services. Metaverse's AR/VR technologies can enable remote medical consultations and training, benefiting patients and healthcare professionals. Additionally, patients can access health-related information and resources, empowering them to manage their health better and make more informed decisions.},

This diverse and interchangeable use of terms makes it challenging for scientific activities to take place and for organisations to grasp the existing opportunities and how can these benefit their businesses. This article aims to shift the focus away from debating a definition for a DT. Instead, it proposes a conceptual approach to the digital twinning of engineering physical assets as an ongoing process with variable complexity and evolutionary capacity over time. To accomplish this, the article presents a functional architecture of digital twinning, grounded in the foundational elements of the DT, to reflect the various forms and levels of digital twinning (LoDT) of physical assets throughout their life cycles. Furthermore, this work presents UNI-TWIN—a unified model to assist organisations in assessing the LoDT of their assets and to support investment planning decisions. Three case studies from the road and rail sector validate its applicability. UNI-TWIN helps to redirect the discussion around DTs and emphasise the opportunities and challenges presented by the diverse realities of digital twinning, namely in the context of engineering asset management.},

abstract = {Natural hazards, which have the potential to cause catastrophic damage and loss to infrastructure, have increased significantly in recent decades. Thus, the construction demand for disaster prevention and mitigation for infrastructure (DPMI) systems is increasing. Many studies have applied intelligence technologies to solve key aspects of infrastructure, such as design, construction, disaster prevention and mitigation, and rescue and recovery; however, systematic construction is still lacking. Digital twin (DT) is one of the most promising technologies for multi-stage management which has great potential to solve the above challenges. This paper initially puts forward a scientific concept, in which DT drives the construction of intelligent disaster prevention and mitigation for infrastructure (IDPMI) systematically. To begin with, a scientific review of DT and IDPMI is performed, where the development of DT is summarized and a DT-based life cycle of infrastructures is defined. In addition, the intelligence technologies used in disaster management are key reviewed and their relative merits are illustrated. Furthermore, the development and technical feasibility of DT-driven IDPMI are illustrated by reviewing the relevant practice of DT in infrastructure. In conclusion, a scientific framework of DT-IDPMI is programmed, which not only provides some guidance for the deep integration between DT and IDPMI but also identifies the challenges that inspire the professional community to advance these techniques to address them in future research.},

abstract = {Data mining technology has gradually become an important data analysis and knowledge discovery technology widely used in many modern industries. Data mining is a technique to find its regularity from a large amount of data by analyzing each data. It mainly includes three steps: data preparation, regularity search, and regularity representation. Data preparation is to select the required data from relevant data sources and integrate them into a data set for data mining; regular search is to find out the regularity contained in the data set by a certain method; regular expression is to be as user-readable as possible. The way of understanding (such as visualization) will represent the found patterns. This research mainly discusses the improvement of teaching mode based on digital twin-based education big data mining. Through the research on the basic principles of data mining and digital twin technology, the student evaluation tool module based on digital twin and the relevant data analysis tool module of students based on digital twin education big data mining are developed. Data mining is carried out from the data of student performance, personal basic information, and evaluation information to find the correlation between various factors, find the hidden laws, and provide support for teaching decision-making. This paper also solves the problem of frequent communication with remote databases according to the characteristics of the database data required by students and improves the efficiency and scalability of education big data mining technology based on digital twins. The goal of the virtual interactive system of the digital twin-based CNC platform is to have both three-dimensional real-time monitoring and remote control functions based on a three-dimensional virtual CNC panel. This research integrates the three-dimensional real-time monitoring and remote control of the virtual interactive system, analyzes the system operation process, develops the system interface, and improves the system sub-functions; it builds an experimental environment, conducts example tests on various functions of the digital twin platform virtual interactive system, and performs virtual interactions system performance indicators are analyzed. 60% of students believe that their innovation ability has been improved after the implementation of the digital twin teaching model; 50% of students believe that their self-evaluation ability has been improved. Applying digital twin's educational big data mining to student information management, university teaching evaluation, student performance analysis, and examination system, it has played a very good guiding role in improving the level of school teaching management.},

Design/methodology/approach: This study used a descriptive survey research design. The population was made up of 1,037 undergraduate in Adeleke University. Descriptive statistic was used to analyse data. Findings: Findings indicated most students have never used virtual reality (VR) equipment, they are eager to use MAL for virtual academic research, library user education, accessing circulation services, reading serials and contacting reference librarians. The study concluded that MAL would be patronised by students if it is made available and therefore recommends that greater effort be made to make VR gear accessible and cheap for developing nations such as Nigeria. Originality/value: The study is novel as it contributes to scarce research on MAL.},

It shows that a socio-technical change programme is required to support the social, human connections between organisations and sectors which allow for the transfer of data and knowledge. We know a paradigm shift is required to break down silos in policy formulation and implementation that are producing suboptimal outcomes. We know we must collectively recognise the built environment as a system of systems and manage it accordingly with more collaborative models built on trust. That way we can create a built environment whose explicit purpose is to enable people and nature to flourish together for generations.},

@article{Enakrire2023,
abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate artificial intelligence (AI) as enabler of future library services, with consideration to how prepared are librarians in African university libraries. Design/methodology/approach: This study applied the interpretive content/document analysis of literature harvested from different databases of Scopus and Web of Science. AI could be used to perform daily routines in circulation, serial, reference and selective dissemination of information among others. It could also be applied to the provision of innovative services of recognition of library activities such as answering research quarries, cataloguing and classification of library materials and management of library system software of different databases within the library systems. Findings: It could be deduced from the study that AI would continue to serve as a panacea to future library services irrespective of its geographical context. Due to the evolving nature of knowledge growth, AI having its roots in the field of engineering has been found useful to support future library services. The support accrued from library service delivery in the library profession has made librarians continue to interact with other intelligent machines that can demonstrate human behaviour even though they are not real human beings. The behaviour of machines and AI where human beings play a significant role has brought many renovations in the management of complex tasks of processing, communication, knowledge representation, decision making and suggestions, on potentials of diverse work operations. Practical implications: The understanding that the present paper portrays in the context of future library services is that there is no way the AI could function without a human interaction perspective when drawing an analogy from computer science, information science and information systems fields of study. Social implications: The interest of users across their background would be strengthen if AI advances transformed the handling complex tasks of processing, communication, knowledge representation, decision-making and giving suggestions, among other things. The possibilities of diverse work operations from empirical evidence of studies consulted in recent times gave the authors the impetus to consider AI as the enabler of future library services. Originality/value: The increasing demands from library patrons have prompted librarians to adapt their methods of delivering services. These emerging technologies have also brought about shifts in approaches to teaching and learning. Consequently, the recent surge in digital technology-driven service innovations has ushered in a fresh paradigm for education and research. In response to these changes, librarians are actively seeking novel and innovative technologies to enhance user experiences within their libraries. They serve as catalysts for introducing modern and advanced technologies, consistently adapting to contemporary tools that enhance their offerings.},

This study used an empirical research method for collecting data from 211 librarians working in Pakistan's universities. On the basis of the findings of the MTAM analysis by structural equation modelling, the performances of the academic libraries were comprehended through the process of big data. The main influential components of the performance analysis in this study were the big data analytics capabilities, perceived ease of access and the usefulness of big data practices in academic libraries. Subsequently, the utilisation of big data was significantly affected by skills, perceived ease of access and the usefulness of academic libraries. The results also suggested that the various components of the academic libraries lead to effective organisational performance when linked to big data analytics.},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to further elaborate a new concept for value creation by decision support services in industrial service ecosystems using digital twins and to apply it to an extended case study. The aim of the original model was to design and integrate an architecture of digital twins derived from business needs that leveraged the potential of the synergies in the ecosystem. The conceptual framework presented in this paper extends the semantic ontology model for integrating the digital twins. For the original model, technical modeling approaches were developed and integrated into an ecosystem perspective based on a modeling of the ecosystem and the actors' decision jobs. In a service ecosystem comprising several enterprises and a multitude of actors, decision making is based on the interlinkage of the digital twins of the equipment and the processes, which is achieved by the semantic ontology model further elaborated in this paper. The implementation of the digital twin architecture is shown in the example of a manufacturing SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) case that was introduced in. The mixed semantic modeling and model-based systems engineering for this implementation is discussed in further detail in this paper. The findings of this detailed study provide a theoretical concept for implementing digital twins on the level of service ecosystems and integrating digital twins based on a unified ontology. This provides a practical blueprint to companies for developing digital twin based services in their own operations and beyond in their ecosystem.},

abstract = {This manuscript discusses the key characteristics of the Digital Ecosystems (DEs) model, which, we argue, is particularly appropriate for connecting and orchestrating the many heterogeneous and autonomous online systems, infrastructures, and platforms that constitute the bedrock of a digitally transformed society. Big Data and AI systems have enabled the implementation of the Digital Twin paradigm (introduced first in the manufacturing sector) in all the sectors of society. DEs promise to be a flexible and operative framework that allow the development of local, national, and international Digital Twins. In particular, the “Digital Twins of the Earth” may generate the actionable intelligence that is necessary to address global change challenges, facilitate the European Green transition, and contribute to realizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda. The case of the Destination Earth initiative and system is discussed in the manuscript as an example to address the broader DE concepts. In respect to the more traditional data and information infrastructural philosophy, DE solutions present important advantages as to flexibility and viability. However, designing and implementing an effective collaborative DE is far more difficult than a traditional digital system. DEs require the definition and the governance of a metasystemic level, which is not necessary for a traditional information system. The manuscript discusses the principles, patterns, and architectural viewpoints characterizing a thriving DE supporting the generation and operation of “Digital Twins of the Earth”. The conclusions present a set of conditions, best practices, and base capabilities for building a knowledge framework, which makes use of the Digital Twin paradigm and the DE approach to support decision makers with the SDG agenda implementation.},

abstract = {The emergence of the metaverse is a notable trend in the field of librarianship that comes with it the capability to facilitate virtual interactions, stimulate engagement, and offer participatory experiences for both librarians and library users. This article delves into the potential applications of the metaverse within libraries. To explore this subject, the researchers conducted a systematic literature review, collecting secondary data that aligns with the study's objectives. The findings emphasize the significance of developing metaliteracy among librarians and library users in the context of the metaverse. Metaliteracy encompasses a diverse set of skills that are essential for thriving in the digital age. Nevertheless, it also presents challenges, such as rapid technological advancements and disparities in accessibility. In response to these challenges, libraries and librarians must adapt by harnessing the power of metaliteracy to unlock the metaverse's potential fully. The article proposes that libraries should provide ongoing training and support for digital librarians and library users to ensure the relevance of their metaliteracy skills. Furthermore, libraries should actively foster collaborative partnerships with entities within the metaverse, including virtual museums and galleries. This collaborative approach enriches the pool of information and resources available to library users, ultimately enhancing their overall experience.},

abstract = {This study aims to investigate the factors influencing the usage intentions of metaverse technology in digital library services within higher learning institutions, using the unified system information theory. To achieve this, an online survey was conducted among university staff and students, utilizing a link-scale measurement. Various factors affecting the usage intention of metaverse technology in library services were computed through transformation models such as UTAUT, DM, ISS, and TTF. Subsequently, the model parameters were empirically tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to identify the significant factors influencing the usage intention of metaverse technology. The results of the study reveal that users' intentions to use metaverse technology in digital library systems are influenced by perceptions of system use, perceived interaction, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use. Notably, these influences vary depending on the user's intended task. These findings provide valuable insights into the factors that affect the adoption and usage intentions of metaverse technology in the context of digital library services in higher learning institutions. This research contributes to enhancing understanding and guiding future strategies for leveraging metaverse technology effectively in educational environments.},

abstract = {In early 2019 UCU decided to review the extent and impact of automation in the higher education sector and to seek to begin to draw together a set of recommendations for trade unions and like-minded bodies. We commissioned the research which comprises the bulk of this report from Dr Ben Williamson from the Centre for Research in Digital Education at the University of Edinburgh, and who has written and researched extensively on the issue. We asked him to review the current reach of automation into higher education and begin to consider what an appropriate response might be. The nature of automation is such that it is constantly evolving and much of what this report details will be outdated in the not too distant future. Indeed, while this report looked at the role of automation on universities the Covid-19 crisis, that erupted after this report was first drafted, has highlighted the significance of remote working and the phenomena of 'Working From Home' in the automated university. Most starkly the gendered nature of this development with predominantly women trying both to maintain work activities whilst retaining primary responsibilities as carers brings equality issues to the fore in any discussion around technology and the university. It is important that trade unions representing workers on our campuses and other interested groups are on top of what is occurring and are giving consideration to an appropriate approach. This report and accompanying recommendations seek to play a role in developing this thinking.},
